8,1,False,8. String to Integer (atoi),"Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function).
The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. ""123"" -> 123, ""0032"" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1.
Return the integer as the final result.

Note:

Only the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.
Do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.

 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""42""
Output: 42
Explanation: The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1: ""42"" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: ""42"" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: ""42"" (""42"" is read in)
           ^
The parsed integer is 42.
Since 42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 42.

Example 2:
Input: s = ""   -42""
Output: -42
Explanation:
Step 1: ""   -42"" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2: ""   -42"" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3: ""   -42"" (""42"" is read in)
               ^
The parsed integer is -42.
Since -42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is -42.

Example 3:
Input: s = ""4193 with words""
Output: 4193
Explanation:
Step 1: ""4193 with words"" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: ""4193 with words"" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: ""4193 with words"" (""4193"" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^
The parsed integer is 4193.
Since 4193 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 4193.

A concatenated substring in s is a substring that contains all the strings of any permutation of words concatenated.

For example, if words = [""ab"",""cd"",""ef""], then ""abcdef"", ""abefcd"", ""cdabef"", ""cdefab"", ""efabcd"", and ""efcdab"" are all concatenated strings. ""acdbef"" is not a concatenated substring because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of words.

Return the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in s. You can return the answer in any order.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""barfoothefoobarman"", words = [""foo"",""bar""]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation: Since words.length == 2 and words[i].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 6.
The substring starting at 0 is ""barfoo"". It is the concatenation of [""bar"",""foo""] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is ""foobar"". It is the concatenation of [""foo"",""bar""] which is a permutation of words.
The output order does not matter. Returning [9,0] is fine too.

Example 2:
Input: s = ""wordgoodgoodgoodbestword"", words = [""word"",""good"",""best"",""word""]
Output: []
Explanation: Since words.length == 4 and words[i].length == 4, the concatenated substring has to be of length 16.
There is no substring of length 16 in s that is equal to the concatenation of any permutation of words.
We return an empty array.

Example 3:
Input: s = ""barfoofoobarthefoobarman"", words = [""bar"",""foo"",""the""]
Output: [6,9,12]
Explanation: Since words.length == 3 and words[i].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 9.
The substring starting at 6 is ""foobarthe"". It is the concatenation of [""foo"",""bar"",""the""] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is ""barthefoo"". It is the concatenation of [""bar"",""the"",""foo""] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 12 is ""thefoobar"". It is the concatenation of [""the"",""foo"",""bar""] which is a permutation of words.

The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.
Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.
For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.

80,2,False,80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II,"Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove some duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears at most twice. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.
Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.
Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.
Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
Custom Judge:
The judge will test your solution with the following code:
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];

87,2,False,87. Scramble String,"We can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following algorithm:

If the length of the string is 1, stop.
If the length of the string is > 1, do the following:
	
Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if the string is s, divide it to x and y where s = x + y.
Randomly decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, s may become s = x + y or s = y + x.
Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings x and y.



Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, return true if s2 is a scrambled string of s1, otherwise, return false.
 
Example 1:
Input: s1 = ""great"", s2 = ""rgeat""
Output: true
Explanation: One possible scenario applied on s1 is:
""great"" --> ""gr/eat"" // divide at random index.
""gr/eat"" --> ""gr/eat"" // random decision is not to swap the two substrings and keep them in order.
""gr/eat"" --> ""g/r / e/at"" // apply the same algorithm recursively on both substrings. divide at random index each of them.
""g/r / e/at"" --> ""r/g / e/at"" // random decision was to swap the first substring and to keep the second substring in the same order.
""r/g / e/at"" --> ""r/g / e/ a/t"" // again apply the algorithm recursively, divide ""at"" to ""a/t"".
""r/g / e/ a/t"" --> ""r/g / e/ a/t"" // random decision is to keep both substrings in the same order.
The algorithm stops now, and the result string is ""rgeat"" which is s2.
As one possible scenario led s1 to be scrambled to s2, we return true.

Split s1 into s1 = ""aa"" + ""bc"" + ""c"", and s2 into s2 = ""dbbc"" + ""a"".
Interleaving the two splits, we get ""aa"" + ""dbbc"" + ""bc"" + ""a"" + ""c"" = ""aadbbcbcac"".
Since s3 can be obtained by interleaving s1 and s2, we return true.

Example 2:
Input: s1 = ""aabcc"", s2 = ""dbbca"", s3 = ""aadbbbaccc""
Output: false
Explanation: Notice how it is impossible to interleave s2 with any other string to obtain s3.

Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly n brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.
For example, if there are two nodes X and Y in the original list, where X.random --> Y, then for the corresponding two nodes x and y in the copied list, x.random --> y.
Return the head of the copied linked list.
The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where:

val: an integer representing Node.val
random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) that the random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.

160,4,False,160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists,"Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1:

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
Custom Judge:
The inputs to the judge are given as follows (your program is not given these inputs):

intersectVal - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is 0 if there is no intersected node.
listA - The first linked list.
listB - The second linked list.
skipA - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listA (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
skipB - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listB (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, headA and headB to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be accepted.
 
Example 1:

Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Intersected at '8'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

Example 2:

Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Intersected at '2'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

Example 3:

Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: No intersection
Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

 
Constraints:

The number of nodes of listA is in the m.
The number of nodes of listB is in the n.
1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104
1 <= Node.val <= 105
0 <= skipA < m
0 <= skipB < n
intersectVal is 0 if listA and listB do not intersect.
intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB] if listA and listB intersect.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
Example 2:

165,4,False,165. Compare Version Numbers,"Given two version numbers, version1 and version2, compare them.


Version numbers consist of one or more revisions joined by a dot '.'. Each revision consists of digits and may contain leading zeros. Every revision contains at least one character. Revisions are 0-indexed from left to right, with the leftmost revision being revision 0, the next revision being revision 1, and so on. For example 2.5.33 and 0.1 are valid version numbers.
To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in left-to-right order. Revisions are compared using their integer value ignoring any leading zeros. This means that revisions 1 and 001 are considered equal. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then treat the revision as 0. For example, version 1.0 is less than version 1.1 because their revision 0s are the same, but their revision 1s are 0 and 1 respectively, and 0 < 1.
Return the following:

If version1 < version2, return -1.
If version1 > version2, return 1.
Otherwise, return 0.

 
Example 1:
Input: version1 = ""1.01"", version2 = ""1.001""
Output: 0
Explanation: Ignoring leading zeroes, both ""01"" and ""001"" represent the same integer ""1"".

Example 2:
Input: version1 = ""1.0"", version2 = ""1.0.0""
Output: 0
Explanation: version1 does not specify revision 2, which means it is treated as ""0"".

Example 3:
Input: version1 = ""0.1"", version2 = ""1.1""
Output: -1
Explanation: version1's revision 0 is ""0"", while version2's revision 0 is ""1"". 0 < 1, so version1 < version2.

The geometric information of each building is given in the array buildings where buildings[i] = [lefti, righti, heighti]:

lefti is the x coordinate of the left edge of the ith building.
righti is the x coordinate of the right edge of the ith building.
heighti is the height of the ith building.

You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0.
The skyline should be represented as a list of ""key points"" sorted by their x-coordinate in the form [[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate 0 and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.
Note: There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, [...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...] is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: [...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]

Explanation: 
On 2013-10-01:
  - There were 4 requests in total, 2 of which were canceled.
  - However, the request with Id=2 was made by a banned client (User_Id=2), so it is ignored in the calculation.
  - Hence there are 3 unbanned requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 3) = 0.33
On 2013-10-02:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The request with Id=6 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (0 / 2) = 0.00
On 2013-10-03:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The request with Id=8 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned request in total, 1 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 2) = 0.50

The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

            - If my number is higher, it must be 6. Guess 6. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.
            - If my number is lower, it must be 4. Guess 4. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.
        - If my number is lower, the range is [1,2]. Guess 1.
            - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $1.
            - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is $7 + $3 + $1 = $11.

The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.

For example, [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3) alternate between positive and negative.
In contrast, [1, 4, 7, 2, 5] and [1, 7, 4, 5, 5] are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero.

388,8,False,388. Longest Absolute File Path,"Suppose we have a file system that stores both files and directories. An example of one system is represented in the following picture:

Here, we have dir as the only directory in the root. dir contains two subdirectories, subdir1 and subdir2. subdir1 contains a file file1.ext and subdirectory subsubdir1. subdir2 contains a subdirectory subsubdir2, which contains a file file2.ext.
In text form, it looks like this (with ⟶ representing the tab character):
dir
⟶ subdir1
⟶ ⟶ file1.ext
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir1
⟶ subdir2
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir2
⟶ ⟶ ⟶ file2.ext

If we were to write this representation in code, it will look like this: ""dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext"". Note that the '\n' and '\t' are the new-line and tab characters.
Every file and directory has a unique absolute path in the file system, which is the order of directories that must be opened to reach the file/directory itself, all concatenated by '/'s. Using the above example, the absolute path to file2.ext is ""dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext"". Each directory name consists of letters, digits, and/or spaces. Each file name is of the form name.extension, where name and extension consist of letters, digits, and/or spaces.
Given a string input representing the file system in the explained format, return the length of the longest absolute path to a file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.
Note that the testcases are generated such that the file system is valid and no file or directory name has length 0.
 
Example 1:

Input: input = ""dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext""
Output: 20
Explanation: We have only one file, and the absolute path is ""dir/subdir2/file.ext"" of length 20.

Input: input = ""dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext""
Output: 32
Explanation: We have two files:
""dir/subdir1/file1.ext"" of length 21
""dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext"" of length 32.
We return 32 since it is the longest absolute path to a file.

For a 1-byte character, the first bit is a 0, followed by its Unicode code.
For an n-bytes character, the first n bits are all one's, the n + 1 bit is 0, followed by n - 1 bytes with the most significant 2 bits being 10.

This is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:

            4          |   11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx

x denotes a bit in the binary form of a byte that may be either 0 or 1.
Note: The input is an array of integers. Only the least significant 8 bits of each integer is used to store the data. This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data.

Explanation: data represents the octet sequence: 11000101 10000010 00000001.

Assume arrk to be an array obtained by rotating nums by k positions clock-wise. We define the rotation function F on nums as follow:

F(k) = 0 * arrk[0] + 1 * arrk[1] + ... + (n - 1) * arrk[n - 1].

Return the maximum value of F(0), F(1), ..., F(n-1).
The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,3,2,6]
Output: 26
Explanation:
F(0) = (0 * 4) + (1 * 3) + (2 * 2) + (3 * 6) = 0 + 3 + 4 + 18 = 25
F(1) = (0 * 6) + (1 * 4) + (2 * 3) + (3 * 2) = 0 + 4 + 6 + 6 = 16
F(2) = (0 * 2) + (1 * 6) + (2 * 4) + (3 * 3) = 0 + 6 + 8 + 9 = 23
F(3) = (0 * 3) + (1 * 2) + (2 * 6) + (3 * 4) = 0 + 2 + 12 + 12 = 26

427,9,False,427. Construct Quad Tree,"Given a n * n matrix grid of 0's and 1's only. We want to represent grid with a Quad-Tree.
Return the root of the Quad-Tree representing grid.
A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:

val: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's. Notice that you can assign the val to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.
isLeaf: True if the node is a leaf node on the tree or False if the node has four children.

class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;
}
We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:

If the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.
If the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.
Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.


If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.
Quad-Tree format:
You don't need to read this section for solving the problem. This is only if you want to understand the output format here. The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.
It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].
If the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.
 
Example 1:

Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: The explanation of this example is shown below:
Notice that 0 represents False and 1 represents True in the photo representing the Quad-Tree.


Example 2:

Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]
Explanation: All values in the grid are not the same. We divide the grid into four sub-grids.
The topLeft, bottomLeft and bottomRight each has the same value.
The topRight have different values so we divide it into 4 sub-grids where each has the same value.
Explanation is shown in the photo below:

430,9,False,430. Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List,"You are given a doubly linked list, which contains nodes that have a next pointer, a previous pointer, and an additional child pointer. This child pointer may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list, also containing these special nodes. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure as shown in the example below.
Given the head of the first level of the list, flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. Let curr be a node with a child list. The nodes in the child list should appear after curr and before curr.next in the flattened list.
Return the head of the flattened list. The nodes in the list must have all of their child pointers set to null.
 
Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]

Explanation: There could be empty list in the input.

 
Constraints:

The number of Nodes will not exceed 1000.

How the multilevel linked list is represented in test cases:
We use the multilevel linked list from Example 1 above:
 1---2---3---4---5---6--NULL
         |
         7---8---9---10--NULL
             |
             11--12--NULL
The serialization of each level is as follows:
[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[7,8,9,10,null]
[11,12,null]

To serialize all levels together, we will add nulls in each level to signify no node connects to the upper node of the previous level. The serialization becomes:
[1,    2,    3, 4, 5, 6, null]
             |
[null, null, 7,    8, 9, 10, null]
                   |
[            null, 11, 12, null]

Merging the serialization of each level and removing trailing nulls we obtain:

458,10,False,458. Poor Pigs,"There are buckets buckets of liquid, where exactly one of the buckets is poisonous. To figure out which one is poisonous, you feed some number of (poor) pigs the liquid to see whether they will die or not. Unfortunately, you only have minutesToTest minutes to determine which bucket is poisonous.
You can feed the pigs according to these steps:

Choose some live pigs to feed.
For each pig, choose which buckets to feed it. The pig will consume all the chosen buckets simultaneously and will take no time. Each pig can feed from any number of buckets, and each bucket can be fed from by any number of pigs.
Wait for minutesToDie minutes. You may not feed any other pigs during this time.
After minutesToDie minutes have passed, any pigs that have been fed the poisonous bucket will die, and all others will survive.
Repeat this process until you run out of time.

Given buckets, minutesToDie, and minutesToTest, return the minimum number of pigs needed to figure out which bucket is poisonous within the allotted time.
 
Example 1:
Input: buckets = 4, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 15
Output: 2
Explanation: We can determine the poisonous bucket as follows:
At time 0, feed the first pig buckets 1 and 2, and feed the second pig buckets 2 and 3.
At time 15, there are 4 possible outcomes:
- If only the first pig dies, then bucket 1 must be poisonous.
- If only the second pig dies, then bucket 3 must be poisonous.
- If both pigs die, then bucket 2 must be poisonous.
- If neither pig dies, then bucket 4 must be poisonous.

Example 2:
Input: buckets = 4, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 30
Output: 2
Explanation: We can determine the poisonous bucket as follows:
At time 0, feed the first pig bucket 1, and feed the second pig bucket 2.
At time 15, there are 2 possible outcomes:
- If either pig dies, then the poisonous bucket is the one it was fed.
- If neither pig dies, then feed the first pig bucket 3, and feed the second pig bucket 4.
At time 30, one of the two pigs must die, and the poisonous bucket is the one it was fed.

460,10,False,460. LFU Cache,"Design and implement a data structure for a Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache.
Implement the LFUCache class:

LFUCache(int capacity) Initializes the object with the capacity of the data structure.
int get(int key) Gets the value of the key if the key exists in the cache. Otherwise, returns -1.
void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if present, or inserts the key if not already present. When the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate and remove the least frequently used key before inserting a new item. For this problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys with the same frequency), the least recently used key would be invalidated.

To determine the least frequently used key, a use counter is maintained for each key in the cache. The key with the smallest use counter is the least frequently used key.
When a key is first inserted into the cache, its use counter is set to 1 (due to the put operation). The use counter for a key in the cache is incremented either a get or put operation is called on it.
The functions get and put must each run in O(1) average time complexity.
 
Example 1:
Input

// cnt(x) = the use counter for key x
// cache=[] will show the last used order for tiebreakers (leftmost element is  most recent)
LFUCache lfu = new LFUCache(2);
lfu.put(1, 1);   // cache=[1,_], cnt(1)=1
lfu.put(2, 2);   // cache=[2,1], cnt(2)=1, cnt(1)=1

                 // cache=[1,2], cnt(2)=1, cnt(1)=2
lfu.put(3, 3);   // 2 is the LFU key because cnt(2)=1 is the smallest, invalidate 2.

                 // cache=[3,1], cnt(3)=2, cnt(1)=2
lfu.put(4, 4);   // Both 1 and 3 have the same cnt, but 1 is LRU, invalidate 1.
                 // cache=[4,3], cnt(4)=1, cnt(3)=2

Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of 0. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., nums[0] or nums[nums.length - 1]) which reduces the size of the array by 1. The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.
Return true if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner, and you should also return true. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,5,2]
Output: false
Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. 
If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). 
So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5. 
Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return false.

In this variation of Zuma, there is a single row of colored balls on a board, where each ball can be colored red 'R', yellow 'Y', blue 'B', green 'G', or white 'W'. You also have several colored balls in your hand.
Your goal is to clear all of the balls from the board. On each turn:

Pick any ball from your hand and insert it in between two balls in the row or on either end of the row.
If there is a group of three or more consecutive balls of the same color, remove the group of balls from the board.
	
If this removal causes more groups of three or more of the same color to form, then continue removing each group until there are none left.


If there are no more balls on the board, then you win the game.
Repeat this process until you either win or do not have any more balls in your hand.

Given a string board, representing the row of balls on the board, and a string hand, representing the balls in your hand, return the minimum number of balls you have to insert to clear all the balls from the board.

Example 1:
Input: board = ""WRRBBW"", hand = ""RB""

Explanation: It is impossible to clear all the balls. The best you can do is:
- Insert 'R' so the board becomes WRRRBBW. WRRRBBW -> WBBW.
- Insert 'B' so the board becomes WBBBW. WBBBW -> WW.
There are still balls remaining on the board, and you are out of balls to insert.
Example 2:
Input: board = ""WWRRBBWW"", hand = ""WRBRW""
Output: 2
Explanation: To make the board empty:
- Insert 'R' so the board becomes WWRRRBBWW. WWRRRBBWW -> WWBBWW.
- Insert 'B' so the board becomes WWBBBWW. WWBBBWW -> WWWW -> empty.
2 balls from your hand were needed to clear the board.

In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the IPO. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most k distinct projects before the IPO. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most k distinct projects.
You are given n projects where the ith project has a pure profit profits[i] and a minimum capital of capital[i] is needed to start it.
Initially, you have w capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.
Pick a list of at most k distinct projects from given projects to maximize your final capital, and return the final maximized capital.
The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.
 
Example 1:
Input: k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.
After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.
With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.
Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.
Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.

You can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise by one place, which counts as one step. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of ring's characters at the ""12:00"" direction, where this character must equal key[i].

This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.

 
Write a solution to report the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places. In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date, then divide that number by the total number of players.

553,12,False,553. Optimal Division,"You are given an integer array nums. The adjacent integers in nums will perform the float division.

For example, for nums = [2,3,4], we will evaluate the expression ""2/3/4"".

However, you can add any number of parenthesis at any position to change the priority of operations. You want to add these parentheses such the value of the expression after the evaluation is maximum.
Return the corresponding expression that has the maximum value in string format.
Note: your expression should not contain redundant parenthesis.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1000,100,10,2]
Output: ""1000/(100/10/2)""
Explanation: 1000/(100/10/2) = 1000/((100/10)/2) = 200
However, the bold parenthesis in ""1000/((100/10)/2)"" are redundant since they do not influence the operation priority.
So you should return ""1000/(100/10/2)"".
Other cases:
1000/(100/10)/2 = 50
1000/(100/(10/2)) = 50
1000/100/10/2 = 0.5

Given quadTree1 and quadTree2. quadTree1 represents a n * n binary matrix and quadTree2 represents another n * n binary matrix.
Return a Quad-Tree representing the n * n binary matrix which is the result of logical bitwise OR of the two binary matrixes represented by quadTree1 and quadTree2.
Notice that you can assign the value of a node to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.
A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:

val: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's.
isLeaf: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.

class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;
}
We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:

If the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.
If the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.
Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.


If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.
Quad-Tree format:
The input/output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.
It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].
If the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.
 
Example 1:
 
Input: quadTree1 = [[0,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0],[1,0]]
, quadTree2 = [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]
Output: [[0,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: quadTree1 and quadTree2 are shown above. You can see the binary matrix which is represented by each Quad-Tree.
If we apply logical bitwise OR on the two binary matrices we get the binary matrix below which is represented by the result Quad-Tree.
Notice that the binary matrices shown are only for illustration, you don't have to construct the binary matrix to get the result tree.


Example 2:
Input: quadTree1 = [[1,0]], quadTree2 = [[1,0]]
Output: [[1,0]]
Explanation: Each tree represents a binary matrix of size 1*1. Each matrix contains only zero.
The resulting matrix is of size 1*1 with also zero.

The code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag. Otherwise, the code is invalid.
A closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : <TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>. Among them, <TAG_NAME> is the start tag, and </TAG_NAME> is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.
A valid TAG_NAME only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the TAG_NAME is invalid.
A valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched <, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the TAG_CONTENT is invalid.
A start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.
A < is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent >. And when you find a < or </, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as TAG_NAME (not necessarily valid).
The cdata has the following format : <![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>. The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between <![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]]>.
CDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse CDATA_CONTENT, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters.

 
Example 1:
Input: code = ""<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>""
Output: true
Explanation: 
The code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. 
The TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. 
Although CDATA_CONTENT has an unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as a tag.
So TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.

Example 2:
Input: code = ""<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>""
Output: true
Explanation:
We first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.
start_tag -> ""<DIV>""
end_tag -> ""</DIV>""
tag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.
text1 -> "">>  ![cdata[]] ""
cdata -> ""<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>"", where the CDATA_CONTENT is ""<div>]>""
text2 -> ""]]>>]""
The reason why start_tag is NOT ""<DIV>>>"" is because of the rule 6.
The reason why cdata is NOT ""<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>"" is because of the rule 7.

Example 3:
Input: code = ""<A>  <B> </A>   </B>""
Output: false
Explanation: Unbalanced. If ""<A>"" is closed, then ""<B>"" must be unmatched, and vice versa.

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| p_id        | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the id of a node and the id of its parent node in a tree.
The given structure is always a valid tree.

 
Each node in the tree can be one of three types:

""Leaf"": if the node is a leaf node.
""Root"": if the node is the root of the tree.
""Inner"": If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.

Write a solution to report the type of each node in the tree.
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example.
 
Example 1:

Input: 
Tree table:
+----+------+
| id | p_id |
+----+------+
| 1  | null |
| 2  | 1    |
| 3  | 1    |
| 4  | 2    |
| 5  | 2    |
+----+------+
Output: 
+----+-------+
| id | type  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Root  |
| 2  | Inner |
| 3  | Leaf  |
| 4  | Leaf  |
| 5  | Leaf  |
+----+-------+
Explanation: 
Node 1 is the root node because its parent node is null and it has child nodes 2 and 3.
Node 2 is an inner node because it has parent node 1 and child node 4 and 5.
Nodes 3, 4, and 5 are leaf nodes because they have parent nodes and they do not have child nodes.

Example 2:

Input: 
Tree table:
+----+------+
| id | p_id |
+----+------+
| 1  | null |
+----+------+
Output: 
+----+-------+
| id | type  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Root  |
+----+-------+
Explanation: If there is only one node on the tree, you only need to output its root attributes.

A group of duplicate files consists of at least two files that have the same content.
A single directory info string in the input list has the following format:

""root/d1/d2/.../dm f1.txt(f1_content) f2.txt(f2_content) ... fn.txt(fn_content)""

It means there are n files (f1.txt, f2.txt ... fn.txt) with content (f1_content, f2_content ... fn_content) respectively in the directory ""root/d1/d2/.../dm"". Note that n >= 1 and m >= 0. If m = 0, it means the directory is just the root directory.
The output is a list of groups of duplicate file paths. For each group, it contains all the file paths of the files that have the same content. A file path is a string that has the following format:

""directory_path/file_name.txt""

 
Example 1:
Input: paths = [""root/a 1.txt(abcd) 2.txt(efgh)"",""root/c 3.txt(abcd)"",""root/c/d 4.txt(efgh)"",""root 4.txt(efgh)""]
Output: [[""root/a/2.txt"",""root/c/d/4.txt"",""root/4.txt""],[""root/a/1.txt"",""root/c/3.txt""]]
Example 2:
Input: paths = [""root/a 1.txt(abcd) 2.txt(efgh)"",""root/c 3.txt(abcd)"",""root/c/d 4.txt(efgh)""]
Output: [[""root/a/2.txt"",""root/c/d/4.txt""],[""root/a/1.txt"",""root/c/3.txt""]]

 
Constraints:

1 <= paths.length <= 2 * 104

You may assume each given directory info represents a unique directory. A single blank space separates the directory path and file info.

 
Follow up:

Imagine you are given a real file system, how will you search files? DFS or BFS?
If the file content is very large (GB level), how will you modify your solution?
If you can only read the file by 1kb each time, how will you modify your solution?

The circular queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle, and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called ""Ring Buffer"".
One of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.
Implement the MyCircularQueue class:

MyCircularQueue(k) Initializes the object with the size of the queue to be k.
int Front() Gets the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
int Rear() Gets the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
boolean enQueue(int value) Inserts an element into the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
boolean deQueue() Deletes an element from the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
boolean isEmpty() Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not.
boolean isFull() Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.

636,13,False,636. Exclusive Time of Functions,"On a single-threaded CPU, we execute a program containing n functions. Each function has a unique ID between 0 and n-1.
Function calls are stored in a call stack: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.
You are given a list logs, where logs[i] represents the ith log message formatted as a string ""{function_id}:{""start"" | ""end""}:{timestamp}"". For example, ""0:start:3"" means a function call with function ID 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3, and ""1:end:2"" means a function call with function ID 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.
A function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for 2 time units and another call executing for 1 time unit, the exclusive time is 2 + 1 = 3.
Return the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the ith index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID i.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 2, logs = [""0:start:0"",""1:start:2"",""1:end:5"",""0:end:6""]
Output: [3,4]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 for units of time and reaches the end of time 1.
Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and ends at the end of time 5.
Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.

Example 2:
Input: n = 1, logs = [""0:start:0"",""0:start:2"",""0:end:5"",""0:start:6"",""0:end:6"",""0:end:7""]
Output: [8]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.
Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.
Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls itself again.
Function 0 (2nd recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.
Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution at the beginning of time 7 and executes for 1 unit of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 units of total time executing.

Example 3:
Input: n = 2, logs = [""0:start:0"",""0:start:2"",""0:end:5"",""1:start:6"",""1:end:6"",""0:end:7""]
Output: [7,1]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.
Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.
Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls function 1.
Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 6, executes 1 unit of time, and ends at the end of time 6.
Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 2 units of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 1 unit of total time executing.

You are also given an array special where special[i] is of size n + 1 where special[i][j] is the number of pieces of the jth item in the ith offer and special[i][n] (i.e., the last integer in the array) is the price of the ith offer.
Return the lowest price you have to pay for exactly certain items as given, where you could make optimal use of the special offers. You are not allowed to buy more items than you want, even if that would lower the overall price. You could use any of the special offers as many times as you want.
 
Example 1:
Input: price = [2,5], special = [[3,0,5],[1,2,10]], needs = [3,2]

Explanation: There are two kinds of items, A and B. Their prices are $2 and $5 respectively. 
In special offer 1, you can pay $5 for 3A and 0B
In special offer 2, you can pay $10 for 1A and 2B.

639,13,False,639. Decode Ways II,"A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:
'A' -> ""1""
'B' -> ""2""
...
'Z' -> ""26""

To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, ""11106"" can be mapped into:

""AAJF"" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)
""KJF"" with the grouping (11 10 6)

Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because ""06"" cannot be mapped into 'F' since ""6"" is different from ""06"".
In addition to the mapping above, an encoded message may contain the '*' character, which can represent any digit from '1' to '9' ('0' is excluded). For example, the encoded message ""1*"" may represent any of the encoded messages ""11"", ""12"", ""13"", ""14"", ""15"", ""16"", ""17"", ""18"", or ""19"". Decoding ""1*"" is equivalent to decoding any of the encoded messages it can represent.
Given a string s consisting of digits and '*' characters, return the number of ways to decode it.
Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""*""
Output: 9
Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages ""1"", ""2"", ""3"", ""4"", ""5"", ""6"", ""7"", ""8"", or ""9"".
Each of these can be decoded to the strings ""A"", ""B"", ""C"", ""D"", ""E"", ""F"", ""G"", ""H"", and ""I"" respectively.
Hence, there are a total of 9 ways to decode ""*"".

Example 2:
Input: s = ""1*""
Output: 18
Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages ""11"", ""12"", ""13"", ""14"", ""15"", ""16"", ""17"", ""18"", or ""19"".
Each of these encoded messages have 2 ways to be decoded (e.g. ""11"" can be decoded to ""AA"" or ""K"").
Hence, there are a total of 9 * 2 = 18 ways to decode ""1*"".

Example 3:
Input: s = ""2*""
Output: 15
Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages ""21"", ""22"", ""23"", ""24"", ""25"", ""26"", ""27"", ""28"", or ""29"".
""21"", ""22"", ""23"", ""24"", ""25"", and ""26"" have 2 ways of being decoded, but ""27"", ""28"", and ""29"" only have 1 way.
Hence, there are a total of (6 * 2) + (3 * 1) = 12 + 3 = 15 ways to decode ""2*"".

649,13,False,649. Dota2 Senate,"In the world of Dota2, there are two parties: the Radiant and the Dire.
The Dota2 senate consists of senators coming from two parties. Now the Senate wants to decide on a change in the Dota2 game. The voting for this change is a round-based procedure. In each round, each senator can exercise one of the two rights:

Ban one senator's right: A senator can make another senator lose all his rights in this and all the following rounds.
Announce the victory: If this senator found the senators who still have rights to vote are all from the same party, he can announce the victory and decide on the change in the game.

Given a string senate representing each senator's party belonging. The character 'R' and 'D' represent the Radiant party and the Dire party. Then if there are n senators, the size of the given string will be n.
The round-based procedure starts from the first senator to the last senator in the given order. This procedure will last until the end of voting. All the senators who have lost their rights will be skipped during the procedure.
Suppose every senator is smart enough and will play the best strategy for his own party. Predict which party will finally announce the victory and change the Dota2 game. The output should be ""Radiant"" or ""Dire"".
 
Example 1:
Input: senate = ""RD""
Output: ""Radiant""
Explanation: 
The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next senator's right in round 1. 
And the second senator can't exercise any rights anymore since his right has been banned. 
And in round 2, the first senator can just announce the victory since he is the only guy in the senate who can vote.

Example 2:
Input: senate = ""RDD""
Output: ""Dire""
Explanation: 
The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next senator's right in round 1. 
And the second senator can't exercise any rights anymore since his right has been banned.

Second Minimum Node In a Binary Tree,"Given a non-empty special binary tree consisting of nodes with the non-negative value, where each node in this tree has exactly two or zero sub-node. If the node has two sub-nodes, then this node's value is the smaller value among its two sub-nodes. More formally, the property root.val = min(root.left.val, root.right.val) always holds.
Given such a binary tree, you need to output the second minimum value in the set made of all the nodes' value in the whole tree.
If no such second minimum value exists, output -1 instead.

0 means the cell cannot be walked through.
1 represents an empty cell that can be walked through.
A number greater than 1 represents a tree in a cell that can be walked through, and this number is the tree's height.

In one step, you can walk in any of the four directions: north, east, south, and west. If you are standing in a cell with a tree, you can choose whether to cut it off.
You must cut off the trees in order from shortest to tallest. When you cut off a tree, the value at its cell becomes 1 (an empty cell).

You are given an array of employees employees where:

employees[i].id is the ID of the ith employee.
employees[i].importance is the importance value of the ith employee.
employees[i].subordinates is a list of the IDs of the direct subordinates of the ith employee.

Given an integer id that represents an employee's ID, return the total importance value of this employee and all their direct and indirect subordinates.
 
Example 1:

Input: employees = [[1,5,[2,3]],[2,3,[]],[3,3,[]]], id = 1
Output: 11
Explanation: Employee 1 has an importance value of 5 and has two direct subordinates: employee 2 and employee 3.
They both have an importance value of 3.
Thus, the total importance value of employee 1 is 5 + 3 + 3 = 11.

Example 2:

Input: employees = [[1,2,[5]],[5,-3,[]]], id = 5
Output: -3
Explanation: Employee 5 has an importance value of -3 and has no direct subordinates.
Thus, the total importance value of employee 5 is -3.

Each square is dropped one at a time from a height above any landed squares. It then falls downward (negative Y direction) until it either lands on the top side of another square or on the X-axis. A square brushing the left/right side of another square does not count as landing on it. Once it lands, it freezes in place and cannot be moved.
After each square is dropped, you must record the height of the current tallest stack of squares.
Return an integer array ans where ans[i] represents the height described above after dropping the ith square.

Example 1:
Input: s1 = ""sea"", s2 = ""eat""
Output: 231
Explanation: Deleting ""s"" from ""sea"" adds the ASCII value of ""s"" (115) to the sum.
Deleting ""t"" from ""eat"" adds 116 to the sum.
At the end, both strings are equal, and 115 + 116 = 231 is the minimum sum possible to achieve this.

Example 2:
Input: s1 = ""delete"", s2 = ""leet""
Output: 403
Explanation: Deleting ""dee"" from ""delete"" to turn the string into ""let"",
adds 100[d] + 101[e] + 101[e] to the sum.
Deleting ""e"" from ""leet"" adds 101[e] to the sum.
At the end, both strings are equal to ""let"", and the answer is 100+101+101+101 = 403.

Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some common email to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.
After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails in sorted order. The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.

722,15,False,722. Remove Comments,"Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array of strings source where source[i] is the ith line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character '\n'.
In C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.

The string ""//"" denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.
The string ""/*"" denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of ""*/"" should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string ""/*/"" does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.

The first effective comment takes precedence over others.

For example, if the string ""//"" occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.
Similarly, if the string ""/*"" occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.

If a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.
There will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.

For example, source = ""string s = ""/* Not a comment. */"";"" will not be a test case.

Also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.
It is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so ""/*"" outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.
Finally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. Please see the examples below for details.
After removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.
 
Example 1:
Input: source = [""/*Test program */"", ""int main()"", ""{ "", ""  // variable declaration "", ""int a, b, c;"", ""/* This is a test"", ""   multiline  "", ""   comment for "", ""   testing */"", ""a = b + c;"", ""}""]
Output: [""int main()"",""{ "",""  "",""int a, b, c;"",""a = b + c;"",""}""]
Explanation: The line by line code is visualized as below:
/*Test program */
int main()
{ 
  // variable declaration 
int a, b, c;
/* This is a test
   multiline  
   comment for 
   testing */
a = b + c;
}
The string /* denotes a block comment, including line 1 and lines 6-9. The string // denotes line 4 as comments.
The line by line output code is visualized as below:
int main()
{ 
  
int a, b, c;
a = b + c;
}

Example 2:
Input: source = [""a/*comment"", ""line"", ""more_comment*/b""]
Output: [""ab""]
Explanation: The original source string is ""a/*comment\nline\nmore_comment*/b"", where we have bolded the newline characters.  After deletion, the implicit newline characters are deleted, leaving the string ""ab"", which when delimited by newline characters becomes [""ab""].

 
Constraints:

1 <= source.length <= 100

For example, ""H2O"" and ""H2O2"" are possible, but ""H1O2"" is impossible.

Two formulas are concatenated together to produce another formula.

For example, ""H2O2He3Mg4"" is also a formula.

You are also given three integers sr, sc, and color. You should perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].
To perform a flood fill, consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with color.
Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.

Explanation: From the center of the image with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1) (i.e., the red pixel), all pixels connected by a path of the same color as the starting pixel (i.e., the blue pixels) are colored with the new color.
Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally connected to the starting pixel.

736,15,False,736. Parse Lisp Expression,"You are given a string expression representing a Lisp-like expression to return the integer value of.
The syntax for these expressions is given as follows.

An expression is either an integer, let expression, add expression, mult expression, or an assigned variable. Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.
(An integer could be positive or negative.)
A let expression takes the form ""(let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr)"", where let is always the string ""let"", then there are one or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable v1 is assigned the value of the expression e1, the second variable v2 is assigned the value of the expression e2, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let expression is the value of the expression expr.
An add expression takes the form ""(add e1 e2)"" where add is always the string ""add"", there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the addition of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.
A mult expression takes the form ""(mult e1 e2)"" where mult is always the string ""mult"", there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.
For this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names. A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits. Additionally, for your convenience, the names ""add"", ""let"", and ""mult"" are protected and will never be used as variable names.
Finally, there is the concept of scope. When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially. It is guaranteed that every expression is legal. Please see the examples for more details on the scope.

 
Example 1:
Input: expression = ""(let x 2 (mult x (let x 3 y 4 (add x y))))""
Output: 14
Explanation: In the expression (add x y), when checking for the value of the variable x,
we check from the innermost scope to the outermost in the context of the variable we are trying to evaluate.
Since x = 3 is found first, the value of x is 3.

Example 2:
Input: expression = ""(let x 3 x 2 x)""
Output: 2
Explanation: Assignment in let statements is processed sequentially.

Example 3:
Input: expression = ""(let x 1 y 2 x (add x y) (add x y))""
Output: 5
Explanation: The first (add x y) evaluates as 3, and is assigned to x.
The second (add x y) evaluates as 3+2 = 5.

There are no leading or trailing spaces in expression.
All tokens are separated by a single space in expression.

A completing word is a word that contains all the letters in licensePlate. Ignore numbers and spaces in licensePlate, and treat letters as case insensitive. If a letter appears more than once in licensePlate, then it must appear in the word the same number of times or more.
For example, if licensePlate = ""aBc 12c"", then it contains letters 'a', 'b' (ignoring case), and 'c' twice. Possible completing words are ""abccdef"", ""caaacab"", and ""cbca"".
Return the shortest completing word in words. It is guaranteed an answer exists. If there are multiple shortest completing words, return the first one that occurs in words.
 
Example 1:
Input: licensePlate = ""1s3 PSt"", words = [""step"",""steps"",""stripe"",""stepple""]
Output: ""steps""
Explanation: licensePlate contains letters 's', 'p', 's' (ignoring case), and 't'.
""step"" contains 't' and 'p', but only contains 1 's'.
""steps"" contains 't', 'p', and both 's' characters.
""stripe"" is missing an 's'.
""stepple"" is missing an 's'.
Since ""steps"" is the only word containing all the letters, that is the answer.

Example 2:
Input: licensePlate = ""1s3 456"", words = [""looks"",""pest"",""stew"",""show""]
Output: ""pest""
Explanation: licensePlate only contains the letter 's'. All the words contain 's', but among these ""pest"", ""stew"", and ""show"" are shortest. The answer is ""pest"" because it is the word that appears earliest of the 3.

 
Constraints:

1 <= licensePlate.length <= 7

749,15,False,749. Contain Virus,"A virus is spreading rapidly, and your task is to quarantine the infected area by installing walls.
The world is modeled as an m x n binary grid isInfected, where isInfected[i][j] == 0 represents uninfected cells, and isInfected[i][j] == 1 represents cells contaminated with the virus. A wall (and only one wall) can be installed between any two 4-directionally adjacent cells, on the shared boundary.
Every night, the virus spreads to all neighboring cells in all four directions unless blocked by a wall. Resources are limited. Each day, you can install walls around only one region (i.e., the affected area (continuous block of infected cells) that threatens the most uninfected cells the following night). There will never be a tie.
Return the number of walls used to quarantine all the infected regions. If the world will become fully infected, return the number of walls used.
 
Example 1:

Input: isInfected = [[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 10
Explanation: There are 2 contaminated regions.
On the first day, add 5 walls to quarantine the viral region on the left. The board after the virus spreads is:

On the second day, add 5 walls to quarantine the viral region on the right. The virus is fully contained.


Example 2:

Input: isInfected = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: Even though there is only one cell saved, there are 4 walls built.
Notice that walls are only built on the shared boundary of two different cells.

Example 3:
Input: isInfected = [[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],[1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 13
Explanation: The region on the left only builds two new walls.

 
Constraints:

The wheels can rotate freely and wrap around: for example we can turn '9' to be '0', or '0' to be '9'. Each move consists of turning one wheel one slot.
The lock initially starts at '0000', a string representing the state of the 4 wheels.
You are given a list of deadends dead ends, meaning if the lock displays any of these codes, the wheels of the lock will stop turning and you will be unable to open it.
Given a target representing the value of the wheels that will unlock the lock, return the minimum total number of turns required to open the lock, or -1 if it is impossible.
 
Example 1:
Input: deadends = [""0201"",""0101"",""0102"",""1212"",""2002""], target = ""0202""
Output: 6
Explanation: 
A sequence of valid moves would be ""0000"" -> ""1000"" -> ""1100"" -> ""1200"" -> ""1201"" -> ""1202"" -> ""0202"".
Note that a sequence like ""0000"" -> ""0001"" -> ""0002"" -> ""0102"" -> ""0202"" would be invalid,
because the wheels of the lock become stuck after the display becomes the dead end ""0102"".

Example 2:
Input: deadends = [""8888""], target = ""0009""
Output: 1
Explanation: We can turn the last wheel in reverse to move from ""0000"" -> ""0009"".

The safe has a peculiar way of checking the password. When you enter in a sequence, it checks the most recent n digits that were entered each time you type a digit.

For example, the correct password is ""345"" and you enter in ""012345"":

	
After typing 0, the most recent 3 digits is ""0"", which is incorrect.
After typing 1, the most recent 3 digits is ""01"", which is incorrect.

Return any string of minimum length that will unlock the safe at some point of entering it.
 
Example 1:

Explanation: The password is a single digit, so enter each digit. ""01"" would also unlock the safe.

To make the pyramid aesthetically pleasing, there are only specific triangular patterns that are allowed. A triangular pattern consists of a single block stacked on top of two blocks. The patterns are given as a list of three-letter strings allowed, where the first two characters of a pattern represent the left and right bottom blocks respectively, and the third character is the top block.

For example, ""ABC"" represents a triangular pattern with a 'C' block stacked on top of an 'A' (left) and 'B' (right) block. Note that this is different from ""BAC"" where 'B' is on the left bottom and 'A' is on the right bottom.

You start with a bottom row of blocks bottom, given as a single string, that you must use as the base of the pyramid.

An expression alternates chunks and symbols, with a space separating each chunk and symbol.
A chunk is either an expression in parentheses, a variable, or a non-negative integer.
A variable is a string of lowercase letters (not including digits.) Note that variables can be multiple letters, and note that variables never have a leading coefficient or unary operator like ""2x"" or ""-x"".

Expressions are evaluated in the usual order: brackets first, then multiplication, then addition and subtraction.

For example, expression = ""1 + 2 * 3"" has an answer of [""7""].

The format of the output is as follows:

For each term of free variables with a non-zero coefficient, we write the free variables within a term in sorted order lexicographically.
	
For example, we would never write a term like ""b*a*c"", only ""a*b*c"".


Terms have degrees equal to the number of free variables being multiplied, counting multiplicity. We write the largest degree terms of our answer first, breaking ties by lexicographic order ignoring the leading coefficient of the term.
	
For example, ""a*a*b*c"" has degree 4.


The leading coefficient of the term is placed directly to the left with an asterisk separating it from the variables (if they exist.) A leading coefficient of 1 is still printed.
An example of a well-formatted answer is [""-2*a*a*a"", ""3*a*a*b"", ""3*b*b"", ""4*a"", ""5*c"", ""-6""].
Terms (including constant terms) with coefficient 0 are not included.
	
For example, an expression of ""0"" has an output of [].



Note: You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of [-231, 231 - 1].
 
Example 1:
Input: expression = ""e + 8 - a + 5"", evalvars = [""e""], evalints = [1]

A number is valid if each digit remains a digit after rotation. For example:

0, 1, and 8 rotate to themselves,
2 and 5 rotate to each other (in this case they are rotated in a different direction, in other words, 2 or 5 gets mirrored),

You start at the point [0, 0], and you are given a destination point target = [xtarget, ytarget] that you are trying to get to. There are several ghosts on the map with their starting positions given as a 2D array ghosts, where ghosts[i] = [xi, yi] represents the starting position of the ith ghost. All inputs are integral coordinates.
Each turn, you and all the ghosts may independently choose to either move 1 unit in any of the four cardinal directions: north, east, south, or west, or stay still. All actions happen simultaneously.
You escape if and only if you can reach the target before any ghost reaches you. If you reach any square (including the target) at the same time as a ghost, it does not count as an escape.
Return true if it is possible to escape regardless of how the ghosts move, otherwise return false.
 
Example 1:
Input: ghosts = [[1,0],[0,3]], target = [0,1]

Afterward, any entries that are less than or equal to their index are worth one point.

For example, if we have nums = [2,4,1,3,0], and we rotate by k = 2, it becomes [1,3,0,2,4]. This is worth 3 points because 1 > 0 [no points], 3 > 1 [no points], 0 <= 2 [one point], 2 <= 3 [one point], 4 <= 4 [one point].

For example, after one cup of champagne is poured, the top most glass is full.  After two cups of champagne are poured, the two glasses on the second row are half full.  After three cups of champagne are poured, those two cups become full - there are 3 full glasses total now.  After four cups of champagne are poured, the third row has the middle glass half full, and the two outside glasses are a quarter full, as pictured below.

You are also given an array hits, which is a sequence of erasures we want to apply. Each time we want to erase the brick at the location hits[i] = (rowi, coli). The brick on that location (if it exists) will disappear. Some other bricks may no longer be stable because of that erasure and will fall. Once a brick falls, it is immediately erased from the grid (i.e., it does not land on other stable bricks).

We erase the underlined brick at (1,1), resulting in the grid:

Next, we erase the underlined brick at (1,0), resulting in the grid:

You are trying to write s across several lines, where each line is no longer than 100 pixels. Starting at the beginning of s, write as many letters on the first line such that the total width does not exceed 100 pixels. Then, from where you stopped in s, continue writing as many letters as you can on the second line. Continue this process until you have written all of s.
Return an array result of length 2 where:

result[0] is the total number of lines.

You are given a 0-indexed n x n integer matrix grid where grid[r][c] represents the height of the building located in the block at row r and column c.
A city's skyline is the outer contour formed by all the building when viewing the side of the city from a distance. The skyline from each cardinal direction north, east, south, and west may be different.
We are allowed to increase the height of any number of buildings by any amount (the amount can be different per building). The height of a 0-height building can also be increased. However, increasing the height of a building should not affect the city's skyline from any cardinal direction.

Serve 50 ml of soup A and 50 ml of soup B, and
Serve 25 ml of soup A and 75 ml of soup B.

When we serve some soup, we give it to someone, and we no longer have it. Each turn, we will choose from the four operations with an equal probability 0.25. If the remaining volume of soup is not enough to complete the operation, we will serve as much as possible. We stop once we no longer have some quantity of both types of soup.

Explanation: If we choose the first two operations, A will become empty first.
For the third operation, A and B will become empty at the same time.
For the fourth operation, B will become empty first.

In these strings like ""heeellooo"", we have groups of adjacent letters that are all the same: ""h"", ""eee"", ""ll"", ""ooo"".
You are given a string s and an array of query strings words. A query word is stretchy if it can be made to be equal to s by any number of applications of the following extension operation: choose a group consisting of characters c, and add some number of characters c to the group so that the size of the group is three or more.

For example, starting with ""hello"", we could do an extension on the group ""o"" to get ""hellooo"", but we cannot get ""helloo"" since the group ""oo"" has a size less than three. Also, we could do another extension like ""ll"" -> ""lllll"" to get ""helllllooo"". If s = ""helllllooo"", then the query word ""hello"" would be stretchy because of these two extension operations: query = ""hello"" -> ""hellooo"" -> ""helllllooo"" = s.

Return the number of query strings that are stretchy.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""heeellooo"", words = [""hello"", ""hi"", ""helo""]

Alice and Bob take turns erasing exactly one number from the chalkboard, with Alice starting first. If erasing a number causes the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard to become 0, then that player loses. The bitwise XOR of one element is that element itself, and the bitwise XOR of no elements is 0.
Also, if any player starts their turn with the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard equal to 0, then that player wins.
Return true if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,2]

Explanation: 
Alice has two choices: erase 1 or erase 2. 
If she erases 1, the nums array becomes [1, 2]. The bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard is 1 XOR 2 = 3. Now Bob can remove any element he wants, because Alice will be the one to erase the last element and she will lose.

When we visit a domain like ""discuss.leetcode.com"", we will also visit the parent domains ""leetcode.com"" and ""com"" implicitly.
A count-paired domain is a domain that has one of the two formats ""rep d1.d2.d3"" or ""rep d1.d2"" where rep is the number of visits to the domain and d1.d2.d3 is the domain itself.

For example, ""9001 discuss.leetcode.com"" is a count-paired domain that indicates that discuss.leetcode.com was visited 9001 times.

Card Flipping Game,"You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays fronts and backs of length n, where the ith card has the positive integer fronts[i] printed on the front and backs[i] printed on the back. Initially, each card is placed on a table such that the front number is facing up and the other is facing down. You may flip over any number of cards (possibly zero).
After flipping the cards, an integer is considered good if it is facing down on some card and not facing up on any card.
Return the minimum possible good integer after flipping the cards. If there are no good integers, return 0.
 
Example 1:
Input: fronts = [1,2,4,4,7], backs = [1,3,4,1,3]

Explanation:
If we flip the second card, the face up numbers are [1,3,4,4,7] and the face down are [1,2,4,1,3].
2 is the minimum good integer as it appears facing down but not facing up.
It can be shown that 2 is the minimum possible good integer obtainable after flipping some cards.

Email address:
An email address is:

A name consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters, followed by
The '@' symbol, followed by
The domain consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters with a dot '.' somewhere in the middle (not the first or last character).

To mask an email:

The uppercase letters in the name and domain must be converted to lowercase letters.
The middle letters of the name (i.e., all but the first and last letters) must be replaced by 5 asterisks ""*****"".

Phone number:
A phone number is formatted as follows:

The phone number contains 10-13 digits.
The last 10 digits make up the local number.
The remaining 0-3 digits, in the beginning, make up the country code.
Separation characters from the set {'+', '-', '(', ')', ' '} separate the above digits in some way.

To mask a phone number:

Remove all separation characters.
The masked phone number should have the form:
	
""***-***-XXXX"" if the country code has 0 digits.
""+*-***-***-XXXX"" if the country code has 1 digit.
""+**-***-***-XXXX"" if the country code has 2 digits.
""+***-***-***-XXXX"" if the country code has 3 digits.


""XXXX"" is the last 4 digits of the local number.

838,17,False,838. Push Dominoes,"There are n dominoes in a line, and we place each domino vertically upright. In the beginning, we simultaneously push some of the dominoes either to the left or to the right.
After each second, each domino that is falling to the left pushes the adjacent domino on the left. Similarly, the dominoes falling to the right push their adjacent dominoes standing on the right.
When a vertical domino has dominoes falling on it from both sides, it stays still due to the balance of the forces.
For the purposes of this question, we will consider that a falling domino expends no additional force to a falling or already fallen domino.
You are given a string dominoes representing the initial state where:

dominoes[i] = 'L', if the ith domino has been pushed to the left,
dominoes[i] = 'R', if the ith domino has been pushed to the right, and
dominoes[i] = '.', if the ith domino has not been pushed.

843,17,False,843. Guess the Word,"You are given an array of unique strings words where words[i] is six letters long. One word of words was chosen as a secret word.
You are also given the helper object Master. You may call Master.guess(word) where word is a six-letter-long string, and it must be from words. Master.guess(word) returns:

-1 if word is not from words, or
an integer representing the number of exact matches (value and position) of your guess to the secret word.

There is a parameter allowedGuesses for each test case where allowedGuesses is the maximum number of times you can call Master.guess(word).
For each test case, you should call Master.guess with the secret word without exceeding the maximum number of allowed guesses. You will get:

""Either you took too many guesses, or you did not find the secret word."" if you called Master.guess more than allowedGuesses times or if you did not call Master.guess with the secret word, or
""You guessed the secret word correctly."" if you called Master.guess with the secret word with the number of calls to Master.guess less than or equal to allowedGuesses.

The test cases are generated such that you can guess the secret word with a reasonable strategy (other than using the bruteforce method).
 
Example 1:
Input: secret = ""acckzz"", words = [""acckzz"",""ccbazz"",""eiowzz"",""abcczz""], allowedGuesses = 10
Output: You guessed the secret word correctly.
Explanation:
master.guess(""aaaaaa"") returns -1, because ""aaaaaa"" is not in wordlist.
master.guess(""acckzz"") returns 6, because ""acckzz"" is secret and has all 6 matches.
master.guess(""ccbazz"") returns 3, because ""ccbazz"" has 3 matches.
master.guess(""eiowzz"") returns 2, because ""eiowzz"" has 2 matches.
master.guess(""abcczz"") returns 4, because ""abcczz"" has 4 matches.
We made 5 calls to master.guess, and one of them was the secret, so we pass the test case.

You are given two integer array position and speed, both of length n, where position[i] is the position of the ith car and speed[i] is the speed of the ith car (in miles per hour).
A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to it and drive bumper to bumper at the same speed. The faster car will slow down to match the slower car's speed. The distance between these two cars is ignored (i.e., they are assumed to have the same position).

Explanation:
The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12.
The car starting at 0 does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.
The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.

874,18,False,874. Walking Robot Simulation,"A robot on an infinite XY-plane starts at point (0, 0) facing north. The robot can receive a sequence of these three possible types of commands:

-2: Turn left 90 degrees.
-1: Turn right 90 degrees.
1 <= k <= 9: Move forward k units, one unit at a time.

Some of the grid squares are obstacles. The ith obstacle is at grid point obstacles[i] = (xi, yi). If the robot runs into an obstacle, then it will instead stay in its current location and move on to the next command.
Return the maximum Euclidean distance that the robot ever gets from the origin squared (i.e. if the distance is 5, return 25).
Note:

North means +Y direction.
East means +X direction.
South means -Y direction.
West means -X direction.
There can be obstacle in [0,0].

 
Example 1:

Explanation: The robot starts at (0, 0):
1. Move north 4 units to (0, 4).
2. Turn right.
3. Move east 3 units to (3, 4).
The furthest point the robot ever gets from the origin is (3, 4), which squared is 32 + 42 = 25 units away.

The objective of the game is to end with the most stones. The total number of stones across all the piles is odd, so there are no ties.
Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. Each turn, a player takes the entire pile of stones either from the beginning or from the end of the row. This continues until there are no more piles left, at which point the person with the most stones wins.
Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return true if Alice wins the game, or false if Bob wins.

909,19,False,909. Snakes and Ladders,"You are given an n x n integer matrix board where the cells are labeled from 1 to n2 in a Boustrophedon style starting from the bottom left of the board (i.e. board[n - 1][0]) and alternating direction each row.
You start on square 1 of the board. In each move, starting from square curr, do the following:

Choose a destination square next with a label in the range [curr + 1, min(curr + 6, n2)].

	
This choice simulates the result of a standard 6-sided die roll: i.e., there are always at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the board.


If next has a snake or ladder, you must move to the destination of that snake or ladder. Otherwise, you move to next.
The game ends when you reach the square n2.

A board square on row r and column c has a snake or ladder if board[r][c] != -1. The destination of that snake or ladder is board[r][c]. Squares 1 and n2 do not have a snake or ladder.
Note that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per move. If the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do not follow the subsequent snake or ladder.

For example, suppose the board is [[-1,4],[-1,3]], and on the first move, your destination square is 2. You follow the ladder to square 3, but do not follow the subsequent ladder to 4.

Return the least number of moves required to reach the square n2. If it is not possible to reach the square, return -1.
 
Example 1:

Input: board = [[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,35,-1,-1,13,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,15,-1,-1,-1,-1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
In the beginning, you start at square 1 (at row 5, column 0).
You decide to move to square 2 and must take the ladder to square 15.
You then decide to move to square 17 and must take the snake to square 13.
You then decide to move to square 14 and must take the ladder to square 35.
You then decide to move to square 36, ending the game.
This is the lowest possible number of moves to reach the last square, so return 4.

Input: board = [[-1,-1],[-1,3]]

The mouse starts at node 1 and goes first, the cat starts at node 2 and goes second, and there is a hole at node 0.
During each player's turn, they must travel along one edge of the graph that meets where they are.  For example, if the Mouse is at node 1, it must travel to any node in graph[1].
Additionally, it is not allowed for the Cat to travel to the Hole (node 0.)
Then, the game can end in three ways:

If ever the Cat occupies the same node as the Mouse, the Cat wins.
If ever the Mouse reaches the Hole, the Mouse wins.

A stone can be removed if it shares either the same row or the same column as another stone that has not been removed.
Given an array stones of length n where stones[i] = [xi, yi] represents the location of the ith stone, return the largest possible number of stones that can be removed.
 
Example 1:
Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: 5
Explanation: One way to remove 5 stones is as follows:
1. Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,1].
2. Remove stone [2,1] because it shares the same column as [0,1].
3. Remove stone [1,2] because it shares the same row as [1,0].
4. Remove stone [1,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0].
5. Remove stone [0,1] because it shares the same row as [0,0].
Stone [0,0] cannot be removed since it does not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.

Example 2:
Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,2],[1,1],[2,0],[2,2]]
Output: 3
Explanation: One way to make 3 moves is as follows:
1. Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,0].
2. Remove stone [2,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0].
3. Remove stone [0,2] because it shares the same row as [0,0].
Stones [0,0] and [1,1] cannot be removed since they do not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.

Return the largest possible score you can achieve after playing any number of tokens.
 
Example 1:

You can order the deck in any order you want. Initially, all the cards start face down (unrevealed) in one deck.
You will do the following steps repeatedly until all cards are revealed:

Take the top card of the deck, reveal it, and take it out of the deck.
If there are still cards in the deck then put the next top card of the deck at the bottom of the deck.
If there are still unrevealed cards, go back to step 1. Otherwise, stop.

Note that the first entry in the answer is considered to be the top of the deck.
 
Example 1:
Input: deck = [17,13,11,2,3,5,7]

Explanation: 
We get the deck in the order [17,13,11,2,3,5,7] (this order does not matter), and reorder it.
After reordering, the deck starts as [2,13,3,11,5,17,7], where 2 is the top of the deck.
We reveal 2, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [3,11,5,17,7,13].
We reveal 3, and move 11 to the bottom.  The deck is now [5,17,7,13,11].
We reveal 5, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [7,13,11,17].
We reveal 7, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [11,17,13].
We reveal 11, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [13,17].
We reveal 13, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [17].

Least Operators to Express Number,"Given a single positive integer x, we will write an expression of the form x (op1) x (op2) x (op3) x ... where each operator op1, op2, etc. is either addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division (+, -, *, or /). For example, with x = 3, we might write 3 * 3 / 3 + 3 - 3 which is a value of 3.
When writing such an expression, we adhere to the following conventions:

The division operator (/) returns rational numbers.
There are no parentheses placed anywhere.
We use the usual order of operations: multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction.
It is not allowed to use the unary negation operator (-). For example, ""x - x"" is a valid expression as it only uses subtraction, but ""-x + x"" is not because it uses negation.

For a given query word, the spell checker handles two categories of spelling mistakes:

Capitalization: If the query matches a word in the wordlist (case-insensitive), then the query word is returned with the same case as the case in the wordlist.

	
Example: wordlist = [""yellow""], query = ""YellOw"": correct = ""yellow""
Example: wordlist = [""Yellow""], query = ""yellow"": correct = ""Yellow""
Example: wordlist = [""yellow""], query = ""yellow"": correct = ""yellow""


Vowel Errors: If after replacing the vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') of the query word with any vowel individually, it matches a word in the wordlist (case-insensitive), then the query word is returned with the same case as the match in the wordlist.
	
Example: wordlist = [""YellOw""], query = ""yollow"": correct = ""YellOw""
Example: wordlist = [""YellOw""], query = ""yeellow"": correct = """" (no match)
Example: wordlist = [""YellOw""], query = ""yllw"": correct = """" (no match)



In addition, the spell checker operates under the following precedence rules:

When the query exactly matches a word in the wordlist (case-sensitive), you should return the same word back.
When the query matches a word up to capitlization, you should return the first such match in the wordlist.
When the query matches a word up to vowel errors, you should return the first such match in the wordlist.
If the query has no matches in the wordlist, you should return the empty string.

Given some queries, return a list of words answer, where answer[i] is the correct word for query = queries[i].

Reverse the sub-array arr[0...k-1] (0-indexed).

For example, if arr = [3,2,1,4] and we performed a pancake flip choosing k = 3, we reverse the sub-array [3,2,1], so arr = [1,2,3,4] after the pancake flip at k = 3.

The (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) jumps in the series are called odd-numbered jumps, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) jumps in the series are called even-numbered jumps. Note that the jumps are numbered, not the indices.
You may jump forward from index i to index j (with i < j) in the following way:

During odd-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index j such that arr[i] <= arr[j] and arr[j] is the smallest possible value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.
During even-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 2, 4, 6, ...), you jump to the index j such that arr[i] >= arr[j] and arr[j] is the largest possible value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.
It may be the case that for some index i, there are no legal jumps.

A starting index is good if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index arr.length - 1) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more than once).
Return the number of good starting indices.
 
Example 1:
Input: arr = [10,13,12,14,15]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
From starting index i = 0, we can make our 1st jump to i = 2 (since arr[2] is the smallest among arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4] that is greater or equal to arr[0]), then we cannot jump any more.
From starting index i = 1 and i = 2, we can make our 1st jump to i = 3, then we cannot jump any more.
From starting index i = 3, we can make our 1st jump to i = 4, so we have reached the end.
From starting index i = 4, we have reached the end already.
In total, there are 2 different starting indices i = 3 and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some number of
jumps.

Example 2:
Input: arr = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
From starting index i = 0, we make jumps to i = 1, i = 2, i = 3:
During our 1st jump (odd-numbered), we first jump to i = 1 because arr[1] is the smallest value in [arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[0].
During our 2nd jump (even-numbered), we jump from i = 1 to i = 2 because arr[2] is the largest value in [arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is less than or equal to arr[1]. arr[3] is also the largest value, but 2 is a smaller index, so we can only jump to i = 2 and not i = 3
During our 3rd jump (odd-numbered), we jump from i = 2 to i = 3 because arr[3] is the smallest value in [arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[2].
We can't jump from i = 3 to i = 4, so the starting index i = 0 is not good.
In a similar manner, we can deduce that:
From starting index i = 1, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.
From starting index i = 2, we jump to i = 3, and then we can't jump anymore.
From starting index i = 3, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.
From starting index i = 4, we are already at the end.
In total, there are 3 different starting indices i = 1, i = 3, and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some

1061,22,False,1061. Lexicographically Smallest Equivalent String,"You are given two strings of the same length s1 and s2 and a string baseStr.
We say s1[i] and s2[i] are equivalent characters.

For example, if s1 = ""abc"" and s2 = ""cde"", then we have 'a' == 'c', 'b' == 'd', and 'c' == 'e'.

Equivalent characters follow the usual rules of any equivalence relation:

Reflexivity: 'a' == 'a'.
Symmetry: 'a' == 'b' implies 'b' == 'a'.
Transitivity: 'a' == 'b' and 'b' == 'c' implies 'a' == 'c'.

For example, given the equivalency information from s1 = ""abc"" and s2 = ""cde"", ""acd"" and ""aab"" are equivalent strings of baseStr = ""eed"", and ""aab"" is the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of baseStr.
Return the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of baseStr by using the equivalency information from s1 and s2.
 
Example 1:
Input: s1 = ""parker"", s2 = ""morris"", baseStr = ""parser""
Output: ""makkek""
Explanation: Based on the equivalency information in s1 and s2, we can group their characters as [m,p], [a,o], [k,r,s], [e,i].
The characters in each group are equivalent and sorted in lexicographical order.
So the answer is ""makkek"".

Example 2:
Input: s1 = ""hello"", s2 = ""world"", baseStr = ""hold""
Output: ""hdld""
Explanation: Based on the equivalency information in s1 and s2, we can group their characters as [h,w], [d,e,o], [l,r].
So only the second letter 'o' in baseStr is changed to 'd', the answer is ""hdld"".

Example 3:
Input: s1 = ""leetcode"", s2 = ""programs"", baseStr = ""sourcecode""
Output: ""aauaaaaada""
Explanation: We group the equivalent characters in s1 and s2 as [a,o,e,r,s,c], [l,p], [g,t] and [d,m], thus all letters in baseStr except 'u' and 'd' are transformed to 'a', the answer is ""aauaaaaada"".

Output: [1.00000,3.00000,2.37500,2.50000,3.00000]
Explanation: The sample represented by count is [1,2,2,2,3,3,3,3].
The minimum and maximum are 1 and 3 respectively.
The mean is (1+2+2+2+3+3+3+3) / 8 = 19 / 8 = 2.375.
Since the size of the sample is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements 2 and 3, which is 2.5.
The mode is 3 as it appears the most in the sample.

Example 2:
Input: count = [0,4,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: [1.00000,4.00000,2.18182,2.00000,1.00000]
Explanation: The sample represented by count is [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4].
The minimum and maximum are 1 and 4 respectively.
The mean is (1+1+1+1+2+2+2+3+3+4+4) / 11 = 24 / 11 = 2.18181818... (for display purposes, the output shows the rounded number 2.18182).
Since the size of the sample is odd, the median is the middle element 2.
The mode is 1 as it appears the most in the sample.

 
Constraints:

count.length == 256
0 <= count[i] <= 109
1 <= sum(count) <= 109
The mode of the sample that count represents is unique.

You may recall that an array arr is a mountain array if and only if:

arr.length >= 3
There exists some i with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such that:
	
arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]
arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]



Given a mountain array mountainArr, return the minimum index such that mountainArr.get(index) == target. If such an index does not exist, return -1.
You cannot access the mountain array directly. You may only access the array using a MountainArray interface:

MountainArray.get(k) returns the element of the array at index k (0-indexed).
MountainArray.length() returns the length of the array.

Submissions making more than 100 calls to MountainArray.get will be judged Wrong Answer. Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.

1096,22,False,1096. Brace Expansion II,"Under the grammar given below, strings can represent a set of lowercase words. Let R(expr) denote the set of words the expression represents.
The grammar can best be understood through simple examples:

Single letters represent a singleton set containing that word.
	
R(""a"") = {""a""}
R(""w"") = {""w""}


When we take a comma-delimited list of two or more expressions, we take the union of possibilities.
	
R(""{a,b,c}"") = {""a"",""b"",""c""}
R(""{{a,b},{b,c}}"") = {""a"",""b"",""c""} (notice the final set only contains each word at most once)


When we concatenate two expressions, we take the set of possible concatenations between two words where the first word comes from the first expression and the second word comes from the second expression.
	
R(""{a,b}{c,d}"") = {""ac"",""ad"",""bc"",""bd""}
R(""a{b,c}{d,e}f{g,h}"") = {""abdfg"", ""abdfh"", ""abefg"", ""abefh"", ""acdfg"", ""acdfh"", ""acefg"", ""acefh""}



Formally, the three rules for our grammar:

For every lowercase letter x, we have R(x) = {x}.
For expressions e1, e2, ... , ek with k >= 2, we have R({e1, e2, ...}) = R(e1) ∪ R(e2) ∪ ...
For expressions e1 and e2, we have R(e1 + e2) = {a + b for (a, b) in R(e1) × R(e2)}, where + denotes concatenation, and × denotes the cartesian product.

Given an expression representing a set of words under the given grammar, return the sorted list of words that the expression represents.
 
Example 1:
Input: expression = ""{a,b}{c,{d,e}}""

Example 2:
Input: expression = ""{{a,z},a{b,c},{ab,z}}""
Output: [""a"",""ab"",""ac"",""z""]

1117,23,False,1117. Building H2O,"There are two kinds of threads: oxygen and hydrogen. Your goal is to group these threads to form water molecules.
There is a barrier where each thread has to wait until a complete molecule can be formed. Hydrogen and oxygen threads will be given releaseHydrogen and releaseOxygen methods respectively, which will allow them to pass the barrier. These threads should pass the barrier in groups of three, and they must immediately bond with each other to form a water molecule. You must guarantee that all the threads from one molecule bond before any other threads from the next molecule do.
In other words:

If an oxygen thread arrives at the barrier when no hydrogen threads are present, it must wait for two hydrogen threads.
If a hydrogen thread arrives at the barrier when no other threads are present, it must wait for an oxygen thread and another hydrogen thread.

We do not have to worry about matching the threads up explicitly; the threads do not necessarily know which other threads they are paired up with. The key is that threads pass the barriers in complete sets; thus, if we examine the sequence of threads that bind and divide them into groups of three, each group should contain one oxygen and two hydrogen threads.
Write synchronization code for oxygen and hydrogen molecules that enforces these constraints.

1143,23,False,1143. Longest Common Subsequence,"Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, ""ace"" is a subsequence of ""abcde"".

A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.
 
Example 1:
Input: text1 = ""abcde"", text2 = ""ace"" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is ""ace"" and its length is 3.

Example 2:
Input: text1 = ""abc"", text2 = ""abc""
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is ""abc"" and its length is 3.

Example 3:
Input: text1 = ""abc"", text2 = ""def""
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.

Initially, the first player names a value x with 1 <= x <= n, and the second player names a value y with 1 <= y <= n and y != x. The first player colors the node with value x red, and the second player colors the node with value y blue.
Then, the players take turns starting with the first player. In each turn, that player chooses a node of their color (red if player 1, blue if player 2) and colors an uncolored neighbor of the chosen node (either the left child, right child, or parent of the chosen node.)
If (and only if) a player cannot choose such a node in this way, they must pass their turn. If both players pass their turn, the game ends, and the winner is the player that colored more nodes.
You are the second player. If it is possible to choose such a y to ensure you win the game, return true. If it is not possible, return false.
 
Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11], n = 11, x = 3

delivery_id is the column of unique values of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).

 
If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.
The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.
Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.

1186,24,False,1186. Maximum Subarray Sum with One Deletion,"Given an array of integers, return the maximum sum for a non-empty subarray (contiguous elements) with at most one element deletion. In other words, you want to choose a subarray and optionally delete one element from it so that there is still at least one element left and the sum of the remaining elements is maximum possible.
Note that the subarray needs to be non-empty after deleting one element.
 
Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,-2,0,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: Because we can choose [1, -2, 0, 3] and drop -2, thus the subarray [1, 0, 3] becomes the maximum value.
Example 2:

Output: 3
Explanation: We just choose [3] and it's the maximum sum.

Example 3:
Input: arr = [-1,-1,-1,-1]

1206,25,False,1206. Design Skiplist,"Design a Skiplist without using any built-in libraries.
A skiplist is a data structure that takes O(log(n)) time to add, erase and search. Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists is just simple linked lists.
For example, we have a Skiplist containing [30,40,50,60,70,90] and we want to add 80 and 45 into it. The Skiplist works this way:

Artyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons
You can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add, erase and search can be faster than O(n). It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).
See more about Skiplist: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list
Implement the Skiplist class:

Skiplist() Initializes the object of the skiplist.
bool search(int target) Returns true if the integer target exists in the Skiplist or false otherwise.
void add(int num) Inserts the value num into the SkipList.
bool erase(int num) Removes the value num from the Skiplist and returns true. If num does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return false. If there exist multiple num values, removing any one of them is fine.

Note that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.
 
Example 1:
Input
[""Skiplist"", ""add"", ""add"", ""add"", ""search"", ""add"", ""search"", ""erase"", ""erase"", ""search""]
[[], [1], [2], [3], [0], [4], [1], [0], [1], [1]]
Output
[null, null, null, null, false, null, true, false, true, false]

Explanation
Skiplist skiplist = new Skiplist();

You want to change s to t. Changing the ith character of s to ith character of t costs |s[i] - t[i]| (i.e., the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters).
Return the maximum length of a substring of s that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of t with a cost less than or equal to maxCost. If there is no substring from s that can be changed to its corresponding substring from t, return 0.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""abcd"", t = ""bcdf"", maxCost = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: ""abc"" of s can change to ""bcd"".
That costs 3, so the maximum length is 3.

Example 2:
Input: s = ""abcd"", t = ""cdef"", maxCost = 3

1226,25,False,1226. The Dining Philosophers,"Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. Forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers.
Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat spaghetti when they have both left and right forks. Each fork can be held by only one philosopher and so a philosopher can use the fork only if it is not being used by another philosopher. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they need to put down both forks so that the forks become available to others. A philosopher can take the fork on their right or the one on their left as they become available, but cannot start eating before getting both forks.
Eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space; an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed.
Design a discipline of behaviour (a concurrent algorithm) such that no philosopher will starve; i.e., each can forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think.

The problem statement and the image above are taken from wikipedia.org
 
The philosophers' ids are numbered from 0 to 4 in a clockwise order. Implement the function void wantsToEat(philosopher, pickLeftFork, pickRightFork, eat, putLeftFork, putRightFork) where:

philosopher is the id of the philosopher who wants to eat.
pickLeftFork and pickRightFork are functions you can call to pick the corresponding forks of that philosopher.
eat is a function you can call to let the philosopher eat once he has picked both forks.
putLeftFork and putRightFork are functions you can call to put down the corresponding forks of that philosopher.
The philosophers are assumed to be thinking as long as they are not asking to eat (the function is not being called with their number).

Five threads, each representing a philosopher, will simultaneously use one object of your class to simulate the process. The function may be called for the same philosopher more than once, even before the last call ends.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: [[4,2,1],[4,1,1],[0,1,1],[2,2,1],[2,1,1],[2,0,3],[2,1,2],[2,2,2],[4,0,3],[4,1,2],[0,2,1],[4,2,2],[3,2,1],[3,1,1],[0,0,3],[0,1,2],[0,2,2],[1,2,1],[1,1,1],[3,0,3],[3,1,2],[3,2,2],[1,0,3],[1,1,2],[1,2,2]]
Explanation:
n is the number of times each philosopher will call the function.
The output array describes the calls you made to the functions controlling the forks and the eat function, its format is:
output[i] = [a, b, c] (three integers)
- a is the id of a philosopher.
- b specifies the fork: {1 : left, 2 : right}.
- c specifies the operation: {1 : pick, 2 : put, 3 : eat}.

While the exact formula is hidden, the function is monotonically increasing, i.e.:

f(x, y) < f(x + 1, y)
f(x, y) < f(x, y + 1)

The function interface is defined like this:
interface CustomFunction {
public:
  // Returns some positive integer f(x, y) for two positive integers x and y based on a formula.
  int f(int x, int y);
};

We will judge your solution as follows:

The judge has a list of 9 hidden implementations of CustomFunction, along with a way to generate an answer key of all valid pairs for a specific z.
The judge will receive two inputs: a function_id (to determine which implementation to test your code with), and the target z.
The judge will call your findSolution and compare your results with the answer key.
If your results match the answer key, your solution will be Accepted.

 
Example 1:
Input: function_id = 1, z = 5
Output: [[1,4],[2,3],[3,2],[4,1]]
Explanation: The hidden formula for function_id = 1 is f(x, y) = x + y.
The following positive integer values of x and y make f(x, y) equal to 5:
x=1, y=4 -> f(1, 4) = 1 + 4 = 5.
x=2, y=3 -> f(2, 3) = 2 + 3 = 5.
x=3, y=2 -> f(3, 2) = 3 + 2 = 5.
x=4, y=1 -> f(4, 1) = 4 + 1 = 5.

Example 2:
Input: function_id = 2, z = 5
Output: [[1,5],[5,1]]
Explanation: The hidden formula for function_id = 2 is f(x, y) = x * y.
The following positive integer values of x and y make f(x, y) equal to 5:
x=1, y=5 -> f(1, 5) = 1 * 5 = 5.
x=5, y=1 -> f(5, 1) = 5 * 1 = 5.

Players take turns placing characters into empty squares ' '.
The first player A always places 'X' characters, while the second player B always places 'O' characters.
'X' and 'O' characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones.
The game ends when there are three of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
No more moves can be played if the game is over.

Given a 2D integer array moves where moves[i] = [rowi, coli] indicates that the ith move will be played on grid[rowi][coli]. return the winner of the game if it exists (A or B). In case the game ends in a draw return ""Draw"". If there are still movements to play return ""Pending"".
You can assume that moves is valid (i.e., it follows the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe), the grid is initially empty, and A will play first.

1328,27,False,1328. Break a Palindrome,"Given a palindromic string of lowercase English letters palindrome, replace exactly one character with any lowercase English letter so that the resulting string is not a palindrome and that it is the lexicographically smallest one possible.
Return the resulting string. If there is no way to replace a character to make it not a palindrome, return an empty string.
A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, a has a character strictly smaller than the corresponding character in b. For example, ""abcc"" is lexicographically smaller than ""abcd"" because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and 'c' is smaller than 'd'.
 
Example 1:
Input: palindrome = ""abccba""
Output: ""aaccba""
Explanation: There are many ways to make ""abccba"" not a palindrome, such as ""zbccba"", ""aaccba"", and ""abacba"".
Of all the ways, ""aaccba"" is the lexicographically smallest.

Example 2:
Input: palindrome = ""a""
Output: """"
Explanation: There is no way to replace a single character to make ""a"" not a palindrome, so return an empty string.

1333,27,False,"1333. Filter Restaurants by Vegan-Friendly, Price and Distance","Given the array restaurants where  restaurants[i] = [idi, ratingi, veganFriendlyi, pricei, distancei]. You have to filter the restaurants using three filters.
The veganFriendly filter will be either true (meaning you should only include restaurants with veganFriendlyi set to true) or false (meaning you can include any restaurant). In addition, you have the filters maxPrice and maxDistance which are the maximum value for price and distance of restaurants you should consider respectively.
Return the array of restaurant IDs after filtering, ordered by rating from highest to lowest. For restaurants with the same rating, order them by id from highest to lowest. For simplicity veganFriendlyi and veganFriendly take value 1 when it is true, and 0 when it is false.
 
Example 1:
Input: restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], veganFriendly = 1, maxPrice = 50, maxDistance = 10
Output: [3,1,5] 
Explanation: 
The restaurants are:
Restaurant 1 [id=1, rating=4, veganFriendly=1, price=40, distance=10]
Restaurant 2 [id=2, rating=8, veganFriendly=0, price=50, distance=5]
Restaurant 3 [id=3, rating=8, veganFriendly=1, price=30, distance=4]
Restaurant 4 [id=4, rating=10, veganFriendly=0, price=10, distance=3]
Restaurant 5 [id=5, rating=1, veganFriendly=1, price=15, distance=1] 
After filter restaurants with veganFriendly = 1, maxPrice = 50 and maxDistance = 10 we have restaurant 3, restaurant 1 and restaurant 5 (ordered by rating from highest to lowest). 

Example 2:
Input: restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], veganFriendly = 0, maxPrice = 50, maxDistance = 10
Output: [4,3,2,1,5]
Explanation: The restaurants are the same as in example 1, but in this case the filter veganFriendly = 0, therefore all restaurants are considered.

Example 3:
Input: restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], veganFriendly = 0, maxPrice = 30, maxDistance = 3

1375,28,False,1375. Number of Times Binary String Is Prefix-Aligned,"You have a 1-indexed binary string of length n where all the bits are 0 initially. We will flip all the bits of this binary string (i.e., change them from 0 to 1) one by one. You are given a 1-indexed integer array flips where flips[i] indicates that the bit at index i will be flipped in the ith step.
A binary string is prefix-aligned if, after the ith step, all the bits in the inclusive range [1, i] are ones and all the other bits are zeros.
Return the number of times the binary string is prefix-aligned during the flipping process.
 
Example 1:
Input: flips = [3,2,4,1,5]
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary string is initially ""00000"".
After applying step 1: The string becomes ""00100"", which is not prefix-aligned.
After applying step 2: The string becomes ""01100"", which is not prefix-aligned.
After applying step 3: The string becomes ""01110"", which is not prefix-aligned.
After applying step 4: The string becomes ""11110"", which is prefix-aligned.
After applying step 5: The string becomes ""11111"", which is prefix-aligned.
We can see that the string was prefix-aligned 2 times, so we return 2.

Example 2:
Input: flips = [4,1,2,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: The binary string is initially ""0000"".
After applying step 1: The string becomes ""0001"", which is not prefix-aligned.
After applying step 2: The string becomes ""1001"", which is not prefix-aligned.
After applying step 3: The string becomes ""1101"", which is not prefix-aligned.
After applying step 4: The string becomes ""1111"", which is prefix-aligned.
We can see that the string was prefix-aligned 1 time, so we return 1.

In one second, the frog jumps from its current vertex to another unvisited vertex if they are directly connected. The frog can not jump back to a visited vertex. In case the frog can jump to several vertices, it jumps randomly to one of them with the same probability. Otherwise, when the frog can not jump to any unvisited vertex, it jumps forever on the same vertex.
The edges of the undirected tree are given in the array edges, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] means that exists an edge connecting the vertices ai and bi.
Return the probability that after t seconds the frog is on the vertex target. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

Explanation: 
Leetcode stock was bought at day 1 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 9000$. Capital gain = 9000 - 1000 = 8000$.
Handbags stock was bought at day 17 for 30000$ and was sold at day 29 for 7000$. Capital loss = 7000 - 30000 = -23000$.
Corona Masks stock was bought at day 1 for 10$ and was sold at day 3 for 1010$. It was bought again at day 4 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 500$. At last, it was bought at day 6 for 1000$ and was sold at day 10 for 10000$. Capital gain/loss is the sum of capital gains/losses for each ('Buy' --> 'Sell') operation = (1010 - 10) + (500 - 1000) + (10000 - 1000) = 1000 - 500 + 9000 = 9500$.

Implement the UndergroundSystem class:

void checkIn(int id, string stationName, int t)

A customer with a card ID equal to id, checks in at the station stationName at time t.
A customer can only be checked into one place at a time.


void checkOut(int id, string stationName, int t)

A customer with a card ID equal to id, checks out from the station stationName at time t.


double getAverageTime(string startStation, string endStation)

Returns the average time it takes to travel from startStation to endStation.
The average time is computed from all the previous traveling times from startStation to endStation that happened directly, meaning a check in at startStation followed by a check out from endStation.
The time it takes to travel from startStation to endStation may be different from the time it takes to travel from endStation to startStation.
There will be at least one customer that has traveled from startStation to endStation before getAverageTime is called.



You may assume all calls to the checkIn and checkOut methods are consistent. If a customer checks in at time t1 then checks out at time t2, then t1 < t2. All events happen in chronological order.

Note that the solution with the given constraints is guaranteed to be unique. Also return the answer sorted in non-increasing order.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,3,10,9,8]
Output: [10,9] 
Explanation: The subsequences [10,9] and [10,8] are minimal such that the sum of their elements is strictly greater than the sum of elements not included. However, the subsequence [10,9] has the maximum total sum of its elements. 

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,4,7,6,7]
Output: [7,7,6] 
Explanation: The subsequence [7,7] has the sum of its elements equal to 14 which is not strictly greater than the sum of elements not included (14 = 4 + 4 + 6). Therefore, the subsequence [7,6,7] is the minimal satisfying the conditions. Note the subsequence has to be returned in non-decreasing order.

1406,29,False,1406. Stone Game III,"Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several stones arranged in a row, and each stone has an associated value which is an integer given in the array stoneValue.
Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each player's turn, that player can take 1, 2, or 3 stones from the first remaining stones in the row.
The score of each player is the sum of the values of the stones taken. The score of each player is 0 initially.
The objective of the game is to end with the highest score, and the winner is the player with the highest score and there could be a tie. The game continues until all the stones have been taken.
Assume Alice and Bob play optimally.
Return ""Alice"" if Alice will win, ""Bob"" if Bob will win, or ""Tie"" if they will end the game with the same score.
 
Example 1:
Input: stoneValue = [1,2,3,7]
Output: ""Bob""
Explanation: Alice will always lose. Her best move will be to take three piles and the score become 6. Now the score of Bob is 7 and Bob wins.

Example 2:
Input: stoneValue = [1,2,3,-9]
Output: ""Alice""
Explanation: Alice must choose all the three piles at the first move to win and leave Bob with negative score.
If Alice chooses one pile her score will be 1 and the next move Bob's score becomes 5. In the next move, Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and lose.
If Alice chooses two piles her score will be 3 and the next move Bob's score becomes 3. In the next move, Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and also lose.
Remember that both play optimally so here Alice will choose the scenario that makes her win.

Example 3:
Input: stoneValue = [1,2,3,6]

In the beginning, you have the permutation P=[1,2,3,...,m].
For the current i, find the position of queries[i] in the permutation P (indexing from 0) and then move this at the beginning of the permutation P. Notice that the position of queries[i] in P is the result for queries[i].

Return an array containing the result for the given queries.
 
Example 1:
Input: queries = [3,1,2,1], m = 5
Output: [2,1,2,1] 
Explanation: The queries are processed as follow: 
For i=0: queries[i]=3, P=[1,2,3,4,5], position of 3 in P is 2, then we move 3 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[3,1,2,4,5]. 
For i=1: queries[i]=1, P=[3,1,2,4,5], position of 1 in P is 1, then we move 1 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[1,3,2,4,5]. 
For i=2: queries[i]=2, P=[1,3,2,4,5], position of 2 in P is 2, then we move 2 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[2,1,3,4,5]. 
For i=3: queries[i]=1, P=[2,1,3,4,5], position of 1 in P is 1, then we move 1 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[1,2,3,4,5].

Input: target = [1,3], n = 3
Output: [""Push"",""Push"",""Pop"",""Push""]
Explanation: Initially the stack s is empty. The last element is the top of the stack.
Read 1 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1].
Read 2 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,2].
Pop the integer on the top of the stack. s = [1].
Read 3 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,3].

Example 2:
Input: target = [1,2,3], n = 3
Output: [""Push"",""Push"",""Push""]
Explanation: Initially the stack s is empty. The last element is the top of the stack.
Read 1 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1].
Read 2 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,2].
Read 3 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,2,3].

Example 3:
Input: target = [1,2], n = 4
Output: [""Push"",""Push""]
Explanation: Initially the stack s is empty. The last element is the top of the stack.
Read 1 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1].
Read 2 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,2].
Since the stack (from the bottom to the top) is equal to target, we stop the stack operations.
The answers that read integer 3 from the stream are not accepted.

All the balls will be shuffled uniformly at random, then we will distribute the first n balls to the first box and the remaining n balls to the other box (Please read the explanation of the second example carefully).
Please note that the two boxes are considered different. For example, if we have two balls of colors a and b, and two boxes [] and (), then the distribution [a] (b) is considered different than the distribution [b] (a) (Please read the explanation of the first example carefully).
Return the probability that the two boxes have the same number of distinct balls. Answers within 10-5 of the actual value will be accepted as correct.
 
Example 1:
Input: balls = [1,1]
Output: 1.00000
Explanation: Only 2 ways to divide the balls equally:
- A ball of color 1 to box 1 and a ball of color 2 to box 2
- A ball of color 2 to box 1 and a ball of color 1 to box 2
In both ways, the number of distinct colors in each box is equal. The probability is 2/2 = 1

Example 2:
Input: balls = [2,1,1]
Output: 0.66667
Explanation: We have the set of balls [1, 1, 2, 3]
This set of balls will be shuffled randomly and we may have one of the 12 distinct shuffles with equal probability (i.e. 1/12):
[1,1 / 2,3], [1,1 / 3,2], [1,2 / 1,3], [1,2 / 3,1], [1,3 / 1,2], [1,3 / 2,1], [2,1 / 1,3], [2,1 / 3,1], [2,3 / 1,1], [3,1 / 1,2], [3,1 / 2,1], [3,2 / 1,1]
After that, we add the first two balls to the first box and the second two balls to the second box.
We can see that 8 of these 12 possible random distributions have the same number of distinct colors of balls in each box.
Probability is 8/12 = 0.66667

Return the minimum number of days you need to wait to be able to make m bouquets from the garden. If it is impossible to make m bouquets return -1.
 
Example 1:
Input: bloomDay = [1,10,3,10,2], m = 3, k = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: Let us see what happened in the first three days. x means flower bloomed and _ means flower did not bloom in the garden.
We need 3 bouquets each should contain 1 flower.
After day 1: [x, _, _, _, _]   // we can only make one bouquet.
After day 2: [x, _, _, _, x]   // we can only make two bouquets.

Example 2:
Input: bloomDay = [1,10,3,10,2], m = 3, k = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: We need 3 bouquets each has 2 flowers, that means we need 6 flowers. We only have 5 flowers so it is impossible to get the needed bouquets and we return -1.

Example 3:
Input: bloomDay = [7,7,7,7,12,7,7], m = 2, k = 3

1488,30,False,1488. Avoid Flood in The City,"Your country has an infinite number of lakes. Initially, all the lakes are empty, but when it rains over the nth lake, the nth lake becomes full of water. If it rains over a lake that is full of water, there will be a flood. Your goal is to avoid floods in any lake.
Given an integer array rains where:

rains[i] > 0 means there will be rains over the rains[i] lake.
rains[i] == 0 means there are no rains this day and you can choose one lake this day and dry it.

Return an array ans where:

ans.length == rains.length
ans[i] == -1 if rains[i] > 0.
ans[i] is the lake you choose to dry in the ith day if rains[i] == 0.

If there are multiple valid answers return any of them. If it is impossible to avoid flood return an empty array.
Notice that if you chose to dry a full lake, it becomes empty, but if you chose to dry an empty lake, nothing changes.
 
Example 1:
Input: rains = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [-1,-1,-1,-1]
Explanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]
After the second day full lakes are [1,2]
After the third day full lakes are [1,2,3]
After the fourth day full lakes are [1,2,3,4]
There's no day to dry any lake and there is no flood in any lake.

Example 2:
Input: rains = [1,2,0,0,2,1]
Output: [-1,-1,2,1,-1,-1]
Explanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]
After the second day full lakes are [1,2]
After the third day, we dry lake 2. Full lakes are [1]
After the fourth day, we dry lake 1. There is no full lakes.
After the fifth day, full lakes are [2].
After the sixth day, full lakes are [1,2].
It is easy that this scenario is flood-free. [-1,-1,1,2,-1,-1] is another acceptable scenario.

Output: []
Explanation: After the second day, full lakes are  [1,2]. We have to dry one lake in the third day.

Find Critical and Pseudo-Critical Edges in Minimum Spanning Tree,"Given a weighted undirected connected graph with n vertices numbered from 0 to n - 1, and an array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi, weighti] represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between nodes ai and bi. A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices without cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.
Find all the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the given graph's minimum spanning tree (MST). An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the MST weight to increase is called a critical edge. On the other hand, a pseudo-critical edge is that which can appear in some MSTs but not all.
Note that you can return the indices of the edges in any order.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,2],[0,3,2],[0,4,3],[3,4,3],[1,4,6]]
Output: [[0,1],[2,3,4,5]]
Explanation: The figure above describes the graph.
The following figure shows all the possible MSTs:

Notice that the two edges 0 and 1 appear in all MSTs, therefore they are critical edges, so we return them in the first list of the output.
The edges 2, 3, 4, and 5 are only part of some MSTs, therefore they are considered pseudo-critical edges. We add them to the second list of the output.

Example 2:

Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,1],[0,3,1]]
Output: [[],[0,1,2,3]]
Explanation: We can observe that since all 4 edges have equal weight, choosing any 3 edges from the given 4 will yield an MST. Therefore all 4 edges are pseudo-critical.

 
Constraints:

Number of Nodes in the Sub-Tree With the Same Label,"You are given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) consisting of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 and exactly n - 1 edges. The root of the tree is the node 0, and each node of the tree has a label which is a lower-case character given in the string labels (i.e. The node with the number i has the label labels[i]).
The edges array is given on the form edges[i] = [ai, bi], which means there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
Return an array of size n where ans[i] is the number of nodes in the subtree of the ith node which have the same label as node i.
A subtree of a tree T is the tree consisting of a node in T and all of its descendant nodes.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], labels = ""abaedcd""
Output: [2,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Explanation: Node 0 has label 'a' and its sub-tree has node 2 with label 'a' as well, thus the answer is 2. Notice that any node is part of its sub-tree.
Node 1 has a label 'b'. The sub-tree of node 1 contains nodes 1,4 and 5, as nodes 4 and 5 have different labels than node 1, the answer is just 1 (the node itself).

Example 2:

Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,3]], labels = ""bbbb""
Output: [4,2,1,1]
Explanation: The sub-tree of node 2 contains only node 2, so the answer is 1.
The sub-tree of node 3 contains only node 3, so the answer is 1.
The sub-tree of node 1 contains nodes 1 and 2, both have label 'b', thus the answer is 2.
The sub-tree of node 0 contains nodes 0, 1, 2 and 3, all with label 'b', thus the answer is 4.

1520,31,False,1520. Maximum Number of Non-Overlapping Substrings,"Given a string s of lowercase letters, you need to find the maximum number of non-empty substrings of s that meet the following conditions:

The substrings do not overlap, that is for any two substrings s[i..j] and s[x..y], either j < x or i > y is true.
A substring that contains a certain character c must also contain all occurrences of c.

Find the maximum number of substrings that meet the above conditions. If there are multiple solutions with the same number of substrings, return the one with minimum total length. It can be shown that there exists a unique solution of minimum total length.
Notice that you can return the substrings in any order.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""adefaddaccc""
Output: [""e"",""f"",""ccc""]
Explanation: The following are all the possible substrings that meet the conditions:
[
  ""adefaddaccc""
  ""adefadda"",
  ""ef"",
  ""e"",
  ""f"",
  ""ccc"",
]
If we choose the first string, we cannot choose anything else and we'd get only 1. If we choose ""adefadda"", we are left with ""ccc"" which is the only one that doesn't overlap, thus obtaining 2 substrings. Notice also, that it's not optimal to choose ""ef"" since it can be split into two. Therefore, the optimal way is to choose [""e"",""f"",""ccc""] which gives us 3 substrings. No other solution of the same number of substrings exist.

Example 2:
Input: s = ""abbaccd""
Output: [""d"",""bb"",""cc""]
Explanation: Notice that while the set of substrings [""d"",""abba"",""cc""] also has length 3, it's considered incorrect since it has larger total length.

Return the number of good leaf node pairs in the tree.
 
Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4], distance = 3

1531,31,False,1531. String Compression II,"Run-length encoding is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string ""aabccc"" we replace ""aa"" by ""a2"" and replace ""ccc"" by ""c3"". Thus the compressed string becomes ""a2bc3"".
Notice that in this problem, we are not adding '1' after single characters.
Given a string s and an integer k. You need to delete at most k characters from s such that the run-length encoded version of s has minimum length.
Find the minimum length of the run-length encoded version of s after deleting at most k characters.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""aaabcccd"", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Compressing s without deleting anything will give us ""a3bc3d"" of length 6. Deleting any of the characters 'a' or 'c' would at most decrease the length of the compressed string to 5, for instance delete 2 'a' then we will have s = ""abcccd"" which compressed is abc3d. Therefore, the optimal way is to delete 'b' and 'd', then the compressed version of s will be ""a3c3"" of length 4.
Example 2:
Input: s = ""aabbaa"", k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: If we delete both 'b' characters, the resulting compressed string would be ""a4"" of length 2.

Example 3:
Input: s = ""aaaaaaaaaaa"", k = 0
Output: 3
Explanation: Since k is zero, we cannot delete anything. The compressed string is ""a11"" of length 3.

Choose any index j (1-indexed) from s, such that 1 <= j <= s.length and j has not been chosen in any previous move, and shift the character at that index i times.
Do nothing.

Shifting a character means replacing it by the next letter in the alphabet (wrapping around so that 'z' becomes 'a'). Shifting a character by i means applying the shift operations i times.
Remember that any index j can be picked at most once.

Given an integer array cuts where cuts[i] denotes a position you should perform a cut at.
You should perform the cuts in order, you can change the order of the cuts as you wish.
The cost of one cut is the length of the stick to be cut, the total cost is the sum of costs of all cuts.

If the number of remaining oranges n is divisible by 2 then you can eat n / 2 oranges.
If the number of remaining oranges n is divisible by 3 then you can eat 2 * (n / 3) oranges.

You can only choose one of the actions per day.
Given the integer n, return the minimum number of days to eat n oranges.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 10
Output: 4
Explanation: You have 10 oranges.
Day 1: Eat 1 orange,  10 - 1 = 9.  
Day 2: Eat 6 oranges, 9 - 2*(9/3) = 9 - 6 = 3. (Since 9 is divisible by 3)
Day 3: Eat 2 oranges, 3 - 2*(3/3) = 3 - 2 = 1. 
Day 4: Eat the last orange  1 - 1  = 0.

Return the length of the shortest subarray to remove.
A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.
 
Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,2,3,10,4,2,3,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: The shortest subarray we can remove is [10,4,2] of length 3. The remaining elements after that will be [1,2,3,3,5] which are sorted.
Another correct solution is to remove the subarray [3,10,4].

Example 2:
Input: arr = [5,4,3,2,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Since the array is strictly decreasing, we can only keep a single element. Therefore we need to remove a subarray of length 4, either [5,4,3,2] or [4,3,2,1].

Example 3:
Input: arr = [1,2,3]

You are also given integers start, finish and fuel representing the starting city, ending city, and the initial amount of fuel you have, respectively.
At each step, if you are at city i, you can pick any city j such that j != i and 0 <= j < locations.length and move to city j. Moving from city i to city j reduces the amount of fuel you have by |locations[i] - locations[j]|. Please notice that |x| denotes the absolute value of x.
Notice that fuel cannot become negative at any point in time, and that you are allowed to visit any city more than once (including start and finish).
Return the count of all possible routes from start to finish. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 
Example 1:

Type 1: Can be traversed by Alice only.
Type 2: Can be traversed by Bob only.
Type 3: Can be traversed by both Alice and Bob.

Given an array edges where edges[i] = [typei, ui, vi] represents a bidirectional edge of type typei between nodes ui and vi, find the maximum number of edges you can remove so that after removing the edges, the graph can still be fully traversed by both Alice and Bob. The graph is fully traversed by Alice and Bob if starting from any node, they can reach all other nodes.
Return the maximum number of edges you can remove, or return -1 if Alice and Bob cannot fully traverse the graph.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 4, edges = [[3,1,2],[3,2,3],[1,1,3],[1,2,4],[1,1,2],[2,3,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation: If we remove the 2 edges [1,1,2] and [1,1,3]. The graph will still be fully traversable by Alice and Bob. Removing any additional edge will not make it so. So the maximum number of edges we can remove is 2.

Example 2:

Input: n = 4, edges = [[3,1,2],[3,2,3],[1,1,4],[2,1,4]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Notice that removing any edge will not make the graph fully traversable by Alice and Bob.

Example 3:

Input: n = 4, edges = [[3,2,3],[1,1,2],[2,3,4]]
Output: -1
Explanation: In the current graph, Alice cannot reach node 4 from the other nodes. Likewise, Bob cannot reach 1. Therefore it's impossible to make the graph fully traversable.

Return the maximum total sum of all requests among all permutations of nums.
Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], requests = [[1,3],[0,1]]
Output: 19
Explanation: One permutation of nums is [2,1,3,4,5] with the following result: 
requests[0] -> nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[3] = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8
requests[1] -> nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 1 = 3

Return the length of the smallest subarray that you need to remove, or -1 if it's impossible.
A subarray is defined as a contiguous block of elements in the array.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,1,4,2], p = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: The sum of the elements in nums is 10, which is not divisible by 6. We can remove the subarray [4], and the sum of the remaining elements is 6, which is divisible by 6.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [6,3,5,2], p = 9
Output: 2
Explanation: We cannot remove a single element to get a sum divisible by 9. The best way is to remove the subarray [5,2], leaving us with [6,3] with sum 9.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3], p = 3

You are given an array customers of length n where customers[i] is the number of new customers arriving just before the ith rotation (0-indexed). This means you must rotate the wheel i times before the customers[i] customers arrive. You cannot make customers wait if there is room in the gondola. Each customer pays boardingCost dollars when they board on the gondola closest to the ground and will exit once that gondola reaches the ground again.
You can stop the wheel at any time, including before serving all customers. If you decide to stop serving customers, all subsequent rotations are free in order to get all the customers down safely. Note that if there are currently more than four customers waiting at the wheel, only four will board the gondola, and the rest will wait for the next rotation.
Return the minimum number of rotations you need to perform to maximize your profit. If there is no scenario where the profit is positive, return -1.
 
Example 1:

Input: customers = [8,3], boardingCost = 5, runningCost = 6
Output: 3
Explanation: The numbers written on the gondolas are the number of people currently there.
1. 8 customers arrive, 4 board and 4 wait for the next gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 4 * $5 - 1 * $6 = $14.
2. 3 customers arrive, the 4 waiting board the wheel and the other 3 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 8 * $5 - 2 * $6 = $28.

2. 9 customers arrive, 4 board and 11 wait (2 originally waiting, 9 newly waiting), the wheel rotates. Current profit is 8 * $6 - 2 * $4 = $40.
3. The final 6 customers arrive, 4 board and 13 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 12 * $6 - 3 * $4 = $60.
4. 4 board and 9 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 16 * $6 - 4 * $4 = $80.
5. 4 board and 5 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 20 * $6 - 5 * $4 = $100.
6. 4 board and 1 waits, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 24 * $6 - 6 * $4 = $120.

The kingdom has a well-defined order of inheritance that consists of the king as the first member. Let's define the recursive function Successor(x, curOrder), which given a person x and the inheritance order so far, returns who should be the next person after x in the order of inheritance.
Successor(x, curOrder):
    if x has no children or all of x's children are in curOrder:
        if x is the king return null
        else return Successor(x's parent, curOrder)
    else return x's oldest child who's not in curOrder

For example, assume we have a kingdom that consists of the king, his children Alice and Bob (Alice is older than Bob), and finally Alice's son Jack.

In the beginning, curOrder will be [""king""].
Calling Successor(king, curOrder) will return Alice, so we append to curOrder to get [""king"", ""Alice""].
Calling Successor(Alice, curOrder) will return Jack, so we append to curOrder to get [""king"", ""Alice"", ""Jack""].
Calling Successor(Jack, curOrder) will return Bob, so we append to curOrder to get [""king"", ""Alice"", ""Jack"", ""Bob""].
Calling Successor(Bob, curOrder) will return null. Thus the order of inheritance will be [""king"", ""Alice"", ""Jack"", ""Bob""].

Using the above function, we can always obtain a unique order of inheritance.
Implement the ThroneInheritance class:

ThroneInheritance(string kingName) Initializes an object of the ThroneInheritance class. The name of the king is given as part of the constructor.
void birth(string parentName, string childName) Indicates that parentName gave birth to childName.
void death(string name) Indicates the death of name. The death of the person doesn't affect the Successor function nor the current inheritance order. You can treat it as just marking the person as dead.
string[] getInheritanceOrder() Returns a list representing the current order of inheritance excluding dead people.

Each server has infinite computational capacity but cannot handle more than one request at a time. The requests are assigned to servers according to a specific algorithm:

The ith (0-indexed) request arrives.
If all servers are busy, the request is dropped (not handled at all).
If the (i % k)th server is available, assign the request to that server.
Otherwise, assign the request to the next available server (wrapping around the list of servers and starting from 0 if necessary). For example, if the ith server is busy, try to assign the request to the (i+1)th server, then the (i+2)th server, and so on.

You are given a strictly increasing array arrival of positive integers, where arrival[i] represents the arrival time of the ith request, and another array load, where load[i] represents the load of the ith request (the time it takes to complete). Your goal is to find the busiest server(s). A server is considered busiest if it handled the most number of requests successfully among all the servers.
Return a list containing the IDs (0-indexed) of the busiest server(s). You may return the IDs in any order.
 
Example 1:

Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4,5], load = [5,2,3,3,3] 
Output: [1] 
Explanation: 
All of the servers start out available.
The first 3 requests are handled by the first 3 servers in order.
Request 3 comes in. Server 0 is busy, so it's assigned to the next available server, which is 1.
Request 4 comes in. It cannot be handled since all servers are busy, so it is dropped.
Servers 0 and 2 handled one request each, while server 1 handled two requests. Hence server 1 is the busiest server.

Example 2:
Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4], load = [1,2,1,2]
Output: [0]
Explanation: 
The first 3 requests are handled by first 3 servers.
Request 3 comes in. It is handled by server 0 since the server is available.
Server 0 handled two requests, while servers 1 and 2 handled one request each. Hence server 0 is the busiest server.

Example 3:
Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3], load = [10,12,11]
Output: [0,1,2]
Explanation: Each server handles a single request, so they are all considered the busiest.

1620,33,False,1620. Coordinate With Maximum Network Quality,"You are given an array of network towers towers, where towers[i] = [xi, yi, qi] denotes the ith network tower with location (xi, yi) and quality factor qi. All the coordinates are integral coordinates on the X-Y plane, and the distance between the two coordinates is the Euclidean distance.
You are also given an integer radius where a tower is reachable if the distance is less than or equal to radius. Outside that distance, the signal becomes garbled, and the tower is not reachable.
The signal quality of the ith tower at a coordinate (x, y) is calculated with the formula ⌊qi / (1 + d)⌋, where d is the distance between the tower and the coordinate. The network quality at a coordinate is the sum of the signal qualities from all the reachable towers.
Return the array [cx, cy] representing the integral coordinate (cx, cy) where the network quality is maximum. If there are multiple coordinates with the same network quality, return the lexicographically minimum non-negative coordinate.
Note:

A coordinate (x1, y1) is lexicographically smaller than (x2, y2) if either:

	
x1 < x2, or
x1 == x2 and y1 < y2.


⌊val⌋ is the greatest integer less than or equal to val (the floor function).

 
Example 1:

Input: towers = [[1,2,5],[2,1,7],[3,1,9]], radius = 2
Output: [2,1]
Explanation: At coordinate (2, 1) the total quality is 13.
- Quality of 7 from (2, 1) results in ⌊7 / (1 + sqrt(0)⌋ = ⌊7⌋ = 7
- Quality of 5 from (1, 2) results in ⌊5 / (1 + sqrt(2)⌋ = ⌊2.07⌋ = 2
- Quality of 9 from (3, 1) results in ⌊9 / (1 + sqrt(1)⌋ = ⌊4.5⌋ = 4
No other coordinate has a higher network quality.
Example 2:
Input: towers = [[23,11,21]], radius = 9
Output: [23,11]
Explanation: Since there is only one tower, the network quality is highest right at the tower's location.

More formally, cities with labels x and y have a road between them if there exists an integer z such that all of the following are true:

x % z == 0,
y % z == 0, and
z > threshold.

Given the two integers, n and threshold, and an array of queries, you must determine for each queries[i] = [ai, bi] if cities ai and bi are connected directly or indirectly. (i.e. there is some path between them).
Return an array answer, where answer.length == queries.length and answer[i] is true if for the ith query, there is a path between ai and bi, or answer[i] is false if there is no path.

Explanation: The divisors for each number are the same as the previous example. However, since the threshold is 0,
all divisors can be used. Since all numbers share 1 as a divisor, all cities are connected.

You are given a string keysPressed of length n, where keysPressed[i] was the ith key pressed in the testing sequence, and a sorted list releaseTimes, where releaseTimes[i] was the time the ith key was released. Both arrays are 0-indexed. The 0th key was pressed at the time 0, and every subsequent key was pressed at the exact time the previous key was released.
The tester wants to know the key of the keypress that had the longest duration. The ith keypress had a duration of releaseTimes[i] - releaseTimes[i - 1], and the 0th keypress had a duration of releaseTimes[0].
Note that the same key could have been pressed multiple times during the test, and these multiple presses of the same key may not have had the same duration.
Return the key of the keypress that had the longest duration. If there are multiple such keypresses, return the lexicographically largest key of the keypresses.
 
Example 1:

Explanation: The keypresses were as follows:
Keypress for 'c' had a duration of 9 (pressed at time 0 and released at time 9).
Keypress for 'b' had a duration of 29 - 9 = 20 (pressed at time 9 right after the release of the previous character and released at time 29).
Keypress for 'c' had a duration of 49 - 29 = 20 (pressed at time 29 right after the release of the previous character and released at time 49).
Keypress for 'd' had a duration of 50 - 49 = 1 (pressed at time 49 right after the release of the previous character and released at time 50).
The longest of these was the keypress for 'b' and the second keypress for 'c', both with duration 20.
'c' is lexicographically larger than 'b', so the answer is 'c'.

Your task is to form target using the given words under the following rules:

target should be formed from left to right.
To form the ith character (0-indexed) of target, you can choose the kth character of the jth string in words if target[i] = words[j][k].
Once you use the kth character of the jth string of words, you can no longer use the xth character of any string in words where x <= k. In other words, all characters to the left of or at index k become unusuable for every string.
Repeat the process until you form the string target.

To decrypt the code, you must replace every number. All the numbers are replaced simultaneously.

If k > 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the next k numbers.
If k < 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the previous k numbers.
If k == 0, replace the ith number with 0.

As code is circular, the next element of code[n-1] is code[0], and the previous element of code[0] is code[n-1].
Given the circular array code and an integer key k, return the decrypted code to defuse the bomb!
 
Example 1:
Input: code = [5,7,1,4], k = 3
Output: [12,10,16,13]
Explanation: Each number is replaced by the sum of the next 3 numbers. The decrypted code is [7+1+4, 1+4+5, 4+5+7, 5+7+1]. Notice that the numbers wrap around.

Example 2:
Input: code = [1,2,3,4], k = 0
Output: [0,0,0,0]
Explanation: When k is zero, the numbers are replaced by 0. 

Example 3:
Input: code = [2,4,9,3], k = -2
Output: [12,5,6,13]
Explanation: The decrypted code is [3+9, 2+3, 4+2, 9+4]. Notice that the numbers wrap around again. If k is negative, the sum is of the previous numbers.

You should decide how many people you want to live in the grid and assign each of them one grid cell. Note that you do not have to have all the people living in the grid.
The happiness of each person is calculated as follows:

Introverts start with 120 happiness and lose 30 happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).
Extroverts start with 40 happiness and gain 20 happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).

Neighbors live in the directly adjacent cells north, east, south, and west of a person's cell.
The grid happiness is the sum of each person's happiness. Return the maximum possible grid happiness.
 
Example 1:

Input: m = 2, n = 3, introvertsCount = 1, extrovertsCount = 2
Output: 240
Explanation: Assume the grid is 1-indexed with coordinates (row, column).
We can put the introvert in cell (1,1) and put the extroverts in cells (1,3) and (2,3).
- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (0 * 30) (0 neighbors) = 120
- Extrovert at (1,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 * 20) (1 neighbor) = 60
- Extrovert at (2,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 * 20) (1 neighbor) = 60
The grid happiness is 120 + 60 + 60 = 240.
The above figure shows the grid in this example with each person's happiness. The introvert stays in the light green cell while the extroverts live on the light purple cells.

Example 2:
Input: m = 3, n = 1, introvertsCount = 2, extrovertsCount = 1
Output: 260
Explanation: Place the two introverts in (1,1) and (3,1) and the extrovert at (2,1).
- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 * 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
- Extrovert at (2,1) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (2 * 20) (2 neighbors) = 80
- Introvert at (3,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 * 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
The grid happiness is 90 + 80 + 90 = 260.

Input: m = 2, n = 2, introvertsCount = 4, extrovertsCount = 0
Output: 240

process_id is the ID of a process running on the machine with ID machine_id.
activity_type is an ENUM (category) of type ('start', 'end').
timestamp is a float representing the current time in seconds.
'start' means the machine starts the process at the given timestamp and 'end' means the machine ends the process at the given timestamp.
The 'start' timestamp will always be before the 'end' timestamp for every (machine_id, process_id) pair.
 
There is a factory website that has several machines each running the same number of processes. Write a solution to find the average time each machine takes to complete a process.
The time to complete a process is the 'end' timestamp minus the 'start' timestamp. The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.

1665,34,False,1665. Minimum Initial Energy to Finish Tasks,"You are given an array tasks where tasks[i] = [actuali, minimumi]:

actuali is the actual amount of energy you spend to finish the ith task.
minimumi is the minimum amount of energy you require to begin the ith task.

For example, if the task is [10, 12] and your current energy is 11, you cannot start this task. However, if your current energy is 13, you can complete this task, and your energy will be 3 after finishing it.
You can finish the tasks in any order you like.
Return the minimum initial amount of energy you will need to finish all the tasks.
 
Example 1:
Input: tasks = [[1,2],[2,4],[4,8]]

The array nums is complementary if for all indices i (0-indexed), nums[i] + nums[n - 1 - i] equals the same number. For example, the array [1,2,3,4] is complementary because for all indices i, nums[i] + nums[n - 1 - i] = 5.
Return the minimum number of moves required to make nums complementary.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,4,3], limit = 4
Output: 1
Explanation: In 1 move, you can change nums to [1,2,2,3] (underlined elements are changed).
nums[0] + nums[3] = 1 + 3 = 4.
nums[1] + nums[2] = 2 + 2 = 4.
nums[2] + nums[1] = 2 + 2 = 4.

There are n stones in a pile. On each player's turn, they can remove a stone from the pile and receive points based on the stone's value. Alice and Bob may value the stones differently.
You are given two integer arrays of length n, aliceValues and bobValues. Each aliceValues[i] and bobValues[i] represents how Alice and Bob, respectively, value the ith stone.
The winner is the person with the most points after all the stones are chosen. If both players have the same amount of points, the game results in a draw. Both players will play optimally. Both players know the other's values.

1687,34,False,1687. Delivering Boxes from Storage to Ports,"You have the task of delivering some boxes from storage to their ports using only one ship. However, this ship has a limit on the number of boxes and the total weight that it can carry.
You are given an array boxes, where boxes[i] = [ports​​i​, weighti], and three integers portsCount, maxBoxes, and maxWeight.

ports​​i is the port where you need to deliver the ith box and weightsi is the weight of the ith box.
portsCount is the number of ports.
maxBoxes and maxWeight are the respective box and weight limits of the ship.

The boxes need to be delivered in the order they are given. The ship will follow these steps:

The ship will take some number of boxes from the boxes queue, not violating the maxBoxes and maxWeight constraints.
For each loaded box in order, the ship will make a trip to the port the box needs to be delivered to and deliver it. If the ship is already at the correct port, no trip is needed, and the box can immediately be delivered.
The ship then makes a return trip to storage to take more boxes from the queue.

The ship must end at storage after all the boxes have been delivered.
Return the minimum number of trips the ship needs to make to deliver all boxes to their respective ports.
 
Example 1:
Input: boxes = [[1,1],[2,1],[1,1]], portsCount = 2, maxBoxes = 3, maxWeight = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The optimal strategy is as follows: 
- The ship takes all the boxes in the queue, goes to port 1, then port 2, then port 1 again, then returns to storage. 4 trips.
So the total number of trips is 4.
Note that the first and third boxes cannot be delivered together because the boxes need to be delivered in order (i.e. the second box needs to be delivered at port 2 before the third box).

Example 2:
Input: boxes = [[1,2],[3,3],[3,1],[3,1],[2,4]], portsCount = 3, maxBoxes = 3, maxWeight = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal strategy is as follows: 
- The ship takes the first box, goes to port 1, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the second, third and fourth boxes, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the fifth box, goes to port 2, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
So the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

Example 3:
Input: boxes = [[1,4],[1,2],[2,1],[2,1],[3,2],[3,4]], portsCount = 3, maxBoxes = 6, maxWeight = 7
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal strategy is as follows:
- The ship takes the first and second boxes, goes to port 1, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the third and fourth boxes, goes to port 2, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the fifth and sixth boxes, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
So the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

1700,34,False,1700. Number of Students Unable to Eat Lunch,"The school cafeteria offers circular and square sandwiches at lunch break, referred to by numbers 0 and 1 respectively. All students stand in a queue. Each student either prefers square or circular sandwiches.
The number of sandwiches in the cafeteria is equal to the number of students. The sandwiches are placed in a stack. At each step:

If the student at the front of the queue prefers the sandwich on the top of the stack, they will take it and leave the queue.
Otherwise, they will leave it and go to the queue's end.

This continues until none of the queue students want to take the top sandwich and are thus unable to eat.
You are given two integer arrays students and sandwiches where sandwiches[i] is the type of the i​​​​​​th sandwich in the stack (i = 0 is the top of the stack) and students[j] is the preference of the j​​​​​​th student in the initial queue (j = 0 is the front of the queue). Return the number of students that are unable to eat.
 
Example 1:
Input: students = [1,1,0,0], sandwiches = [0,1,0,1]
Output: 0 
Explanation:
- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [1,0,0,1].
- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [0,0,1,1].
- Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [0,1,1] and sandwiches = [1,0,1].
- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [1,1,0].
- Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [1,0] and sandwiches = [0,1].
- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [0,1].
- Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [1] and sandwiches = [1].
- Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [] and sandwiches = [].
Hence all students are able to eat.

1701,35,False,1701. Average Waiting Time,"There is a restaurant with a single chef. You are given an array customers, where customers[i] = [arrivali, timei]:

arrivali is the arrival time of the ith customer. The arrival times are sorted in non-decreasing order.
timei is the time needed to prepare the order of the ith customer.

When a customer arrives, he gives the chef his order, and the chef starts preparing it once he is idle. The customer waits till the chef finishes preparing his order. The chef does not prepare food for more than one customer at a time. The chef prepares food for customers in the order they were given in the input.
Return the average waiting time of all customers. Solutions within 10-5 from the actual answer are considered accepted.
 
Example 1:
Input: customers = [[1,2],[2,5],[4,3]]
Output: 5.00000
Explanation:
1) The first customer arrives at time 1, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it immediately at time 1, and finishes at time 3, so the waiting time of the first customer is 3 - 1 = 2.
2) The second customer arrives at time 2, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it at time 3, and finishes at time 8, so the waiting time of the second customer is 8 - 2 = 6.
3) The third customer arrives at time 4, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it at time 8, and finishes at time 11, so the waiting time of the third customer is 11 - 4 = 7.
So the average waiting time = (2 + 6 + 7) / 3 = 5.

Example 2:
Input: customers = [[5,2],[5,4],[10,3],[20,1]]
Output: 3.25000
Explanation:
1) The first customer arrives at time 5, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it immediately at time 5, and finishes at time 7, so the waiting time of the first customer is 7 - 5 = 2.
2) The second customer arrives at time 5, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it at time 7, and finishes at time 11, so the waiting time of the second customer is 11 - 5 = 6.
3) The third customer arrives at time 10, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it at time 11, and finishes at time 14, so the waiting time of the third customer is 14 - 10 = 4.
4) The fourth customer arrives at time 20, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it immediately at time 20, and finishes at time 21, so the waiting time of the fourth customer is 21 - 20 = 1.
So the average waiting time = (2 + 6 + 4 + 1) / 4 = 3.25.

The integer 1 occurs once in the sequence.
Each integer between 2 and n occurs twice in the sequence.
For every integer i between 2 and n, the distance between the two occurrences of i is exactly i.

The distance between two numbers on the sequence, a[i] and a[j], is the absolute difference of their indices, |j - i|.
Return the lexicographically largest sequence. It is guaranteed that under the given constraints, there is always a solution. 
A sequence a is lexicographically larger than a sequence b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, sequence a has a number greater than the corresponding number in b. For example, [0,1,9,0] is lexicographically larger than [0,1,5,6] because the first position they differ is at the third number, and 9 is greater than 5.

Each turn you choose two different non-empty piles, take one stone from each, and add 1 point to your score. The game stops when there are fewer than two non-empty piles (meaning there are no more available moves).
Given three integers a​​​​​, b,​​​​​ and c​​​​​, return the maximum score you can get.
 
Example 1:
Input: a = 2, b = 4, c = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: The starting state is (2, 4, 6). One optimal set of moves is:
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 4, 5)
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 4, 4)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 3, 3)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 2, 2)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 1, 1)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 0, 0)
There are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends. Total: 6 points.

Example 2:
Input: a = 4, b = 4, c = 6

If word1 is non-empty, append the first character in word1 to merge and delete it from word1.

	
For example, if word1 = ""abc"" and merge = ""dv"", then after choosing this operation, word1 = ""bc"" and merge = ""dva"".


If word2 is non-empty, append the first character in word2 to merge and delete it from word2.
	
For example, if word2 = ""abc"" and merge = """", then after choosing this operation, word2 = ""bc"" and merge = ""a"".



Return the lexicographically largest merge you can construct.
A string a is lexicographically larger than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, a has a character strictly larger than the corresponding character in b. For example, ""abcd"" is lexicographically larger than ""abcc"" because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and d is greater than c.
 
Example 1:
Input: word1 = ""cabaa"", word2 = ""bcaaa""
Output: ""cbcabaaaaa""
Explanation: One way to get the lexicographically largest merge is:
- Take from word1: merge = ""c"", word1 = ""abaa"", word2 = ""bcaaa""
- Take from word2: merge = ""cb"", word1 = ""abaa"", word2 = ""caaa""
- Take from word2: merge = ""cbc"", word1 = ""abaa"", word2 = ""aaa""

For each session, the user will receive a new authentication token that will expire timeToLive seconds after the currentTime. If the token is renewed, the expiry time will be extended to expire timeToLive seconds after the (potentially different) currentTime.
Implement the AuthenticationManager class:

AuthenticationManager(int timeToLive) constructs the AuthenticationManager and sets the timeToLive.
generate(string tokenId, int currentTime) generates a new token with the given tokenId at the given currentTime in seconds.
renew(string tokenId, int currentTime) renews the unexpired token with the given tokenId at the given currentTime in seconds. If there are no unexpired tokens with the given tokenId, the request is ignored, and nothing happens.
countUnexpiredTokens(int currentTime) returns the number of unexpired tokens at the given currentTime.

Note that if a token expires at time t, and another action happens on time t (renew or countUnexpiredTokens), the expiration takes place before the other actions.

authenticationManager.generate(""bbb"", 7); // Generates a new token with tokenId ""bbb"" at time 7.
authenticationManager.renew(""aaa"", 8); // The token with tokenId ""aaa"" expired at time 7, and 8 >= 7, so at time 8 the renew request is ignored, and nothing happens.
authenticationManager.renew(""bbb"", 10); // The token with tokenId ""bbb"" is unexpired at time 10, so the renew request is fulfilled and now the token will expire at time 15.

0 if it is a batch of buy orders, or
1 if it is a batch of sell orders.

Note that orders[i] represents a batch of amounti independent orders with the same price and order type. All orders represented by orders[i] will be placed before all orders represented by orders[i+1] for all valid i.
There is a backlog that consists of orders that have not been executed. The backlog is initially empty. When an order is placed, the following happens:

If the order is a buy order, you look at the sell order with the smallest price in the backlog. If that sell order's price is smaller than or equal to the current buy order's price, they will match and be executed, and that sell order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the buy order is added to the backlog.
Vice versa, if the order is a sell order, you look at the buy order with the largest price in the backlog. If that buy order's price is larger than or equal to the current sell order's price, they will match and be executed, and that buy order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the sell order is added to the backlog.

Return the total amount of orders in the backlog after placing all the orders from the input. Since this number can be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 
Example 1:

Output: 6
Explanation: Here is what happens with the orders:
- 5 orders of type buy with price 10 are placed. There are no sell orders, so the 5 orders are added to the backlog.
- 2 orders of type sell with price 15 are placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 15, so the 2 orders are added to the backlog.
- 1 order of type sell with price 25 is placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 25 in the backlog, so this order is added to the backlog.
- 4 orders of type buy with price 30 are placed. The first 2 orders are matched with the 2 sell orders of the least price, which is 15 and these 2 sell orders are removed from the backlog. The 3rd order is matched with the sell order of the least price, which is 25 and this sell order is removed from the backlog. Then, there are no more sell orders in the backlog, so the 4th order is added to the backlog.
Finally, the backlog has 5 buy orders with price 10, and 1 buy order with price 30. So the total number of orders in the backlog is 6.

Example 2:

Input: orders = [[7,1000000000,1],[15,3,0],[5,999999995,0],[5,1,1]]
Output: 999999984
Explanation: Here is what happens with the orders:
- 109 orders of type sell with price 7 are placed. There are no buy orders, so the 109 orders are added to the backlog.
- 3 orders of type buy with price 15 are placed. They are matched with the 3 sell orders with the least price which is 7, and those 3 sell orders are removed from the backlog.
- 999999995 orders of type buy with price 5 are placed. The least price of a sell order is 7, so the 999999995 orders are added to the backlog.
- 1 order of type sell with price 5 is placed. It is matched with the buy order of the highest price, which is 5, and that buy order is removed from the backlog.
Finally, the backlog has (1000000000-3) sell orders with price 7, and (999999995-1) buy orders with price 5. So the total number of orders = 1999999991, which is equal to 999999984 % (109 + 7).

For example, in the string ""(name)is(age)yearsold"", there are two bracket pairs that contain the keys ""name"" and ""age"".

You know the values of a wide range of keys. This is represented by a 2D string array knowledge where each knowledge[i] = [keyi, valuei] indicates that key keyi has a value of valuei.
You are tasked to evaluate all of the bracket pairs. When you evaluate a bracket pair that contains some key keyi, you will:

Replace keyi and the bracket pair with the key's corresponding valuei.
If you do not know the value of the key, you will replace keyi and the bracket pair with a question mark ""?"" (without the quotation marks).

Explanation: Here are the steps of the game:
1) Start at friend 1.
2) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 1 and 2.
3) Friend 2 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 3.
4) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 3 and 4.
5) Friend 4 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 5.
6) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 5 and 1.
7) Friend 1 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 3.
8) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 3 and 5.
9) Friend 5 leaves the circle. Only friend 3 is left, so they are the winner.

You are given an array obstacles of length n + 1 where each obstacles[i] (ranging from 0 to 3) describes an obstacle on the lane obstacles[i] at point i. If obstacles[i] == 0, there are no obstacles at point i. There will be at most one obstacle in the 3 lanes at each point.

For example, if obstacles[2] == 1, then there is an obstacle on lane 1 at point 2.

The frog can only travel from point i to point i + 1 on the same lane if there is not an obstacle on the lane at point i + 1. To avoid obstacles, the frog can also perform a side jump to jump to another lane (even if they are not adjacent) at the same point if there is no obstacle on the new lane.

For example, the frog can jump from lane 3 at point 3 to lane 1 at point 3.

Tasks are assigned to the servers using a task queue. Initially, all servers are free, and the queue is empty.
At second j, the jth task is inserted into the queue (starting with the 0th task being inserted at second 0). As long as there are free servers and the queue is not empty, the task in the front of the queue will be assigned to a free server with the smallest weight, and in case of a tie, it is assigned to a free server with the smallest index.
If there are no free servers and the queue is not empty, we wait until a server becomes free and immediately assign the next task.

To arrive at your meeting, you have to travel through n roads. The road lengths are given as an integer array dist of length n, where dist[i] describes the length of the ith road in kilometers. In addition, you are given an integer speed, which is the speed (in km/h) you will travel at.
After you travel road i, you must rest and wait for the next integer hour before you can begin traveling on the next road. Note that you do not have to rest after traveling the last road because you are already at the meeting.

For example, if traveling a road takes 1.4 hours, you must wait until the 2 hour mark before traveling the next road. If traveling a road takes exactly 2 hours, you do not need to wait.

However, you are allowed to skip some rests to be able to arrive on time, meaning you do not need to wait for the next integer hour. Note that this means you may finish traveling future roads at different hour marks.

For example, suppose traveling the first road takes 1.4 hours and traveling the second road takes 0.6 hours. Skipping the rest after the first road will mean you finish traveling the second road right at the 2 hour mark, letting you start traveling the third road immediately.

Return the minimum number of skips required to arrive at the meeting on time, or -1 if it is impossible.
 
Example 1:
Input: dist = [1,3,2], speed = 4, hoursBefore = 2
Output: 1
Explanation:
Without skipping any rests, you will arrive in (1/4 + 3/4) + (3/4 + 1/4) + (2/4) = 2.5 hours.
You can skip the first rest to arrive in ((1/4 + 0) + (3/4 + 0)) + (2/4) = 1.5 hours.
Note that the second rest is shortened because you finish traveling the second road at an integer hour due to skipping the first rest.

Example 2:
Input: dist = [7,3,5,5], speed = 2, hoursBefore = 10
Output: 2
Explanation:
Without skipping any rests, you will arrive in (7/2 + 1/2) + (3/2 + 1/2) + (5/2 + 1/2) + (5/2) = 11.5 hours.
You can skip the first and third rest to arrive in ((7/2 + 0) + (3/2 + 0)) + ((5/2 + 0) + (5/2)) = 10 hours.

Otherwise, if both eggs survive, we know that f = 2.

Example 2:
Input: n = 100
Output: 14
Explanation: One optimal strategy is:
- Drop the 1st egg at floor 9. If it breaks, we know f is between 0 and 8. Drop the 2nd egg starting from floor 1 and going up one at a time to find f within 8 more drops. Total drops is 1 + 8 = 9.
- If the 1st egg does not break, drop the 1st egg again at floor 22. If it breaks, we know f is between 9 and 21. Drop the 2nd egg starting from floor 10 and going up one at a time to find f within 12 more drops. Total drops is 2 + 12 = 14.
- If the 1st egg does not break again, follow a similar process dropping the 1st egg from floors 34, 45, 55, 64, 72, 79, 85, 90, 94, 97, 99, and 100.

1889,38,False,1889. Minimum Space Wasted From Packaging,"You have n packages that you are trying to place in boxes, one package in each box. There are m suppliers that each produce boxes of different sizes (with infinite supply). A package can be placed in a box if the size of the package is less than or equal to the size of the box.
The package sizes are given as an integer array packages, where packages[i] is the size of the ith package. The suppliers are given as a 2D integer array boxes, where boxes[j] is an array of box sizes that the jth supplier produces.
You want to choose a single supplier and use boxes from them such that the total wasted space is minimized. For each package in a box, we define the space wasted to be size of the box - size of the package. The total wasted space is the sum of the space wasted in all the boxes.

For example, if you have to fit packages with sizes [2,3,5] and the supplier offers boxes of sizes [4,8], you can fit the packages of size-2 and size-3 into two boxes of size-4 and the package with size-5 into a box of size-8. This would result in a waste of (4-2) + (4-3) + (8-5) = 6.

Return the minimum total wasted space by choosing the box supplier optimally, or -1 if it is impossible to fit all the packages inside boxes. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 
Example 1:
Input: packages = [2,3,5], boxes = [[4,8],[2,8]]
Output: 6
Explanation: It is optimal to choose the first supplier, using two size-4 boxes and one size-8 box.
The total waste is (4-2) + (4-3) + (8-5) = 6.

Example 2:
Input: packages = [2,3,5], boxes = [[1,4],[2,3],[3,4]]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no box that the package of size 5 can fit in.

Example 3:
Input: packages = [3,5,8,10,11,12], boxes = [[12],[11,9],[10,5,14]]
Output: 9
Explanation: It is optimal to choose the third supplier, using two size-5 boxes, two size-10 boxes, and two size-14 boxes.
The total waste is (5-3) + (5-5) + (10-8) + (10-10) + (14-11) + (14-12) = 9.

The teacher will give each student a problem starting with the student number 0, then the student number 1, and so on until the teacher reaches the student number n - 1. After that, the teacher will restart the process, starting with the student number 0 again.
You are given a 0-indexed integer array chalk and an integer k. There are initially k pieces of chalk. When the student number i is given a problem to solve, they will use chalk[i] pieces of chalk to solve that problem. However, if the current number of chalk pieces is strictly less than chalk[i], then the student number i will be asked to replace the chalk.

For example, ""()1|1"" and ""(1)&()"" are not valid while ""1"", ""(((1))|(0))"", and ""1|(0&(1))"" are valid expressions.

Return the minimum cost to change the final value of the expression.

For example, if expression = ""1|1|(0&0)&1"", its value is 1|1|(0&0)&1 = 1|1|0&1 = 1|0&1 = 1&1 = 1. We want to apply operations so that the new expression evaluates to 0.

The cost of changing the final value of an expression is the number of operations performed on the expression. The types of operations are described as follows:

Turn a '1' into a '0'.
Turn a '0' into a '1'.
Turn a '&' into a '|'.
Turn a '|' into a '&'.

Note: '&' does not take precedence over '|' in the order of calculation. Evaluate parentheses first, then in left-to-right order.
 
Example 1:

More formally, you will mark the character at s[removable[i]] for each 0 <= i < k, then remove all marked characters and check if p is still a subsequence.
Return the maximum k you can choose such that p is still a subsequence of s after the removals.
A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""abcacb"", p = ""ab"", removable = [3,1,0]

Explanation: After removing the characters at indices 3 and 1, ""abcacb"" becomes ""accb"".
""ab"" is a subsequence of ""accb"".
If we remove the characters at indices 3, 1, and 0, ""abcacb"" becomes ""ccb"", and ""ab"" is no longer a subsequence.
Hence, the maximum k is 2.

Example 2:
Input: s = ""abcbddddd"", p = ""abcd"", removable = [3,2,1,4,5,6]

The players are standing in a single row and are numbered from 1 to n based on their initial standing position (player 1 is the first player in the row, player 2 is the second player in the row, etc.).
The tournament consists of multiple rounds (starting from round number 1). In each round, the ith player from the front of the row competes against the ith player from the end of the row, and the winner advances to the next round. When the number of players is odd for the current round, the player in the middle automatically advances to the next round.

For example, if the row consists of players 1, 2, 4, 6, 7

Player 1 competes against player 7.
Player 2 competes against player 6.
Player 4 automatically advances to the next round.



After each round is over, the winners are lined back up in the row based on the original ordering assigned to them initially (ascending order).
The players numbered firstPlayer and secondPlayer are the best in the tournament. They can win against any other player before they compete against each other. If any two other players compete against each other, either of them might win, and thus you may choose the outcome of this round.
Given the integers n, firstPlayer, and secondPlayer, return an integer array containing two values, the earliest possible round number and the latest possible round number in which these two players will compete against each other, respectively.

For example, the second round starts at 00:15, the fourth round starts at 00:45, and the seventh round starts at 01:30.

You are given two strings loginTime and logoutTime where:

loginTime is the time you will login to the game, and
logoutTime is the time you will logout from the game.

If logoutTime is earlier than loginTime, this means you have played from loginTime to midnight and from midnight to logoutTime.
Return the number of full chess rounds you have played in the tournament.
Note: All the given times follow the 24-hour clock. That means the first round of the day starts at 00:00 and the last round of the day starts at 23:45.
 
Example 1:
Input: loginTime = ""09:31"", logoutTime = ""10:14""
Output: 1
Explanation: You played one full round from 09:45 to 10:00.
You did not play the full round from 09:30 to 09:45 because you logged in at 09:31 after it began.
You did not play the full round from 10:00 to 10:15 because you logged out at 10:14 before it ended.

Each movie is given as a 2D integer array entries where entries[i] = [shopi, moviei, pricei] indicates that there is a copy of movie moviei at shop shopi with a rental price of pricei. Each shop carries at most one copy of a movie moviei.
The system should support the following functions:

Search: Finds the cheapest 5 shops that have an unrented copy of a given movie. The shops should be sorted by price in ascending order, and in case of a tie, the one with the smaller shopi should appear first. If there are less than 5 matching shops, then all of them should be returned. If no shop has an unrented copy, then an empty list should be returned.
Rent: Rents an unrented copy of a given movie from a given shop.
Drop: Drops off a previously rented copy of a given movie at a given shop.
Report: Returns the cheapest 5 rented movies (possibly of the same movie ID) as a 2D list res where res[j] = [shopj, moviej] describes that the jth cheapest rented movie moviej was rented from the shop shopj. The movies in res should be sorted by price in ascending order, and in case of a tie, the one with the smaller shopj should appear first, and if there is still tie, the one with the smaller moviej should appear first.

1921,39,False,1921. Eliminate Maximum Number of Monsters,"You are playing a video game where you are defending your city from a group of n monsters. You are given a 0-indexed integer array dist of size n, where dist[i] is the initial distance in kilometers of the ith monster from the city.
The monsters walk toward the city at a constant speed. The speed of each monster is given to you in an integer array speed of size n, where speed[i] is the speed of the ith monster in kilometers per minute.
You have a weapon that, once fully charged, can eliminate a single monster. However, the weapon takes one minute to charge. The weapon is fully charged at the very start.
You lose when any monster reaches your city. If a monster reaches the city at the exact moment the weapon is fully charged, it counts as a loss, and the game ends before you can use your weapon.
Return the maximum number of monsters that you can eliminate before you lose, or n if you can eliminate all the monsters before they reach the city.
 
Example 1:

You are also given the entrance of the maze, where entrance = [entrancerow, entrancecol] denotes the row and column of the cell you are initially standing at.
In one step, you can move one cell up, down, left, or right. You cannot step into a cell with a wall, and you cannot step outside the maze. Your goal is to find the nearest exit from the entrance. An exit is defined as an empty cell that is at the border of the maze. The entrance does not count as an exit.
Return the number of steps in the shortest path from the entrance to the nearest exit, or -1 if no such path exists.
 
Example 1:

Input: maze = [[""+"",""+"",""."",""+""],[""."",""."",""."",""+""],[""+"",""+"",""+"","".""]], entrance = [1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: There are 3 exits in this maze at [1,0], [0,2], and [2,3].
Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,2].
- You can reach [1,0] by moving 2 steps left.
- You can reach [0,2] by moving 1 step up.
It is impossible to reach [2,3] from the entrance.
Thus, the nearest exit is [0,2], which is 1 step away.

Input: maze = [[""+"",""+"",""+""],[""."",""."","".""],[""+"",""+"",""+""]], entrance = [1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is 1 exit in this maze at [1,2].
[1,0] does not count as an exit since it is the entrance cell.
Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,0].
- You can reach [1,2] by moving 2 steps right.
Thus, the nearest exit is [1,2], which is 2 steps away.

1927,39,False,1927. Sum Game,"Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.
You are given a string num of even length consisting of digits and '?' characters. On each turn, a player will do the following if there is still at least one '?' in num:

Choose an index i where num[i] == '?'.
Replace num[i] with any digit between '0' and '9'.

The game ends when there are no more '?' characters in num.
For Bob to win, the sum of the digits in the first half of num must be equal to the sum of the digits in the second half. For Alice to win, the sums must not be equal.

For example, if the game ended with num = ""243801"", then Bob wins because 2+4+3 = 8+0+1. If the game ended with num = ""243803"", then Alice wins because 2+4+3 != 8+0+3.

Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return true if Alice will win and false if Bob will win.
 
Example 1:
Input: num = ""5023""
Output: false
Explanation: There are no moves to be made.
The sum of the first half is equal to the sum of the second half: 5 + 0 = 2 + 3.

Example 2:
Input: num = ""25??""
Output: true
Explanation: Alice can replace one of the '?'s with '9' and it will be impossible for Bob to make the sums equal.

Example 3:
Input: num = ""?3295???""
Output: false
Explanation: It can be proven that Bob will always win. One possible outcome is:
- Alice replaces the first '?' with '9'. num = ""93295???"".
- Bob replaces one of the '?' in the right half with '9'. num = ""932959??"".
- Alice replaces one of the '?' in the right half with '2'. num = ""9329592?"".

There may be multiple roads of differing travel times connecting the same two cities, but no road connects a city to itself.
Each time you pass through a city, you must pay a passing fee. This is represented as a 0-indexed integer array passingFees of length n where passingFees[j] is the amount of dollars you must pay when you pass through city j.
In the beginning, you are at city 0 and want to reach city n - 1 in maxTime minutes or less. The cost of your journey is the summation of passing fees for each city that you passed through at some moment of your journey (including the source and destination cities).

Output: 48
Explanation: The path to take is 0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, which takes 26 minutes and has $48 worth of passing fees.
You cannot take path 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5 since it would take too long.

1943,39,False,1943. Describe the Painting,"There is a long and thin painting that can be represented by a number line. The painting was painted with multiple overlapping segments where each segment was painted with a unique color. You are given a 2D integer array segments, where segments[i] = [starti, endi, colori] represents the half-closed segment [starti, endi) with colori as the color.
The colors in the overlapping segments of the painting were mixed when it was painted. When two or more colors mix, they form a new color that can be represented as a set of mixed colors.

For example, if colors 2, 4, and 6 are mixed, then the resulting mixed color is {2,4,6}.

For the sake of simplicity, you should only output the sum of the elements in the set rather than the full set.
You want to describe the painting with the minimum number of non-overlapping half-closed segments of these mixed colors. These segments can be represented by the 2D array painting where painting[j] = [leftj, rightj, mixj] describes a half-closed segment [leftj, rightj) with the mixed color sum of mixj.

For example, the painting created with segments = [[1,4,5],[1,7,7]] can be described by painting = [[1,4,12],[4,7,7]] because:

	
[1,4) is colored {5,7} (with a sum of 12) from both the first and second segments.
[4,7) is colored {7} from only the second segment.



Return the 2D array painting describing the finished painting (excluding any parts that are not painted). You may return the segments in any order.
A half-closed segment [a, b) is the section of the number line between points a and b including point a and not including point b.
 
Example 1:

Input: segments = [[1,4,5],[4,7,7],[1,7,9]]
Output: [[1,4,14],[4,7,16]]
Explanation: The painting can be described as follows:
- [1,4) is colored {5,9} (with a sum of 14) from the first and third segments.
- [4,7) is colored {7,9} (with a sum of 16) from the second and third segments.

Example 2:

Input: segments = [[1,7,9],[6,8,15],[8,10,7]]
Output: [[1,6,9],[6,7,24],[7,8,15],[8,10,7]]
Explanation: The painting can be described as follows:
- [1,6) is colored 9 from the first segment.
- [6,7) is colored {9,15} (with a sum of 24) from the first and second segments.
- [7,8) is colored 15 from the second segment.
- [8,10) is colored 7 from the third segment.

Example 3:

Input: segments = [[1,4,5],[1,4,7],[4,7,1],[4,7,11]]

First, convert s into an integer by replacing each letter with its position in the alphabet (i.e., replace 'a' with 1, 'b' with 2, ..., 'z' with 26). Then, transform the integer by replacing it with the sum of its digits. Repeat the transform operation k times in total.
For example, if s = ""zbax"" and k = 2, then the resulting integer would be 8 by the following operations:

Convert: ""zbax"" ➝ ""(26)(2)(1)(24)"" ➝ ""262124"" ➝ 262124
Transform #1: 262124 ➝ 2 + 6 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 ➝ 17

Two folders (not necessarily on the same level) are identical if they contain the same non-empty set of identical subfolders and underlying subfolder structure. The folders do not need to be at the root level to be identical. If two or more folders are identical, then mark the folders as well as all their subfolders.

1969,40,False,1969. Minimum Non-Zero Product of the Array Elements,"You are given a positive integer p. Consider an array nums (1-indexed) that consists of the integers in the inclusive range [1, 2p - 1] in their binary representations. You are allowed to do the following operation any number of times:

Choose two elements x and y from nums.
Choose a bit in x and swap it with its corresponding bit in y. Corresponding bit refers to the bit that is in the same position in the other integer.

For example, if x = 1101 and y = 0011, after swapping the 2nd bit from the right, we have x = 1111 and y = 0001.
Find the minimum non-zero product of nums after performing the above operation any number of times. Return this product modulo 109 + 7.
Note: The answer should be the minimum product before the modulo operation is done.
 
Example 1:
Input: p = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: nums = [1].
There is only one element, so the product equals that element.

Example 2:
Input: p = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: nums = [01, 10, 11].
Any swap would either make the product 0 or stay the same.
Thus, the array product of 1 * 2 * 3 = 6 is already minimized.

Example 3:
Input: p = 3
Output: 1512
Explanation: nums = [001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111]
- In the first operation we can swap the leftmost bit of the second and fifth elements.
    - The resulting array is [001, 110, 011, 100, 001, 110, 111].
- In the second operation we can swap the middle bit of the third and fourth elements.
    - The resulting array is [001, 110, 001, 110, 001, 110, 111].
The array product is 1 * 6 * 1 * 6 * 1 * 6 * 7 = 1512, which is the minimum possible product.

The root of the tree is node 0, so parent[0] = -1 since it has no parent. You want to design a data structure that allows users to lock, unlock, and upgrade nodes in the tree.
The data structure should support the following functions:

Lock: Locks the given node for the given user and prevents other users from locking the same node. You may only lock a node using this function if the node is unlocked.
Unlock: Unlocks the given node for the given user. You may only unlock a node using this function if it is currently locked by the same user.
Upgrade: Locks the given node for the given user and unlocks all of its descendants regardless of who locked it. You may only upgrade a node if all 3 conditions are true:
	
The node is unlocked,
It has at least one locked descendant (by any user), and
It does not have any locked ancestors.



Implement the LockingTree class:

LockingTree(int[] parent) initializes the data structure with the parent array.
lock(int num, int user) returns true if it is possible for the user with id user to lock the node num, or false otherwise. If it is possible, the node num will become locked by the user with id user.
unlock(int num, int user) returns true if it is possible for the user with id user to unlock the node num, or false otherwise. If it is possible, the node num will become unlocked.
upgrade(int num, int user) returns true if it is possible for the user with id user to upgrade the node num, or false otherwise. If it is possible, the node num will be upgraded.

2017,41,False,2017. Grid Game,"You are given a 0-indexed 2D array grid of size 2 x n, where grid[r][c] represents the number of points at position (r, c) on the matrix. Two robots are playing a game on this matrix.
Both robots initially start at (0, 0) and want to reach (1, n-1). Each robot may only move to the right ((r, c) to (r, c + 1)) or down ((r, c) to (r + 1, c)).
At the start of the game, the first robot moves from (0, 0) to (1, n-1), collecting all the points from the cells on its path. For all cells (r, c) traversed on the path, grid[r][c] is set to 0. Then, the second robot moves from (0, 0) to (1, n-1), collecting the points on its path. Note that their paths may intersect with one another.
The first robot wants to minimize the number of points collected by the second robot. In contrast, the second robot wants to maximize the number of points it collects. If both robots play optimally, return the number of points collected by the second robot.

2019,41,False,2019. The Score of Students Solving Math Expression,"You are given a string s that contains digits 0-9, addition symbols '+', and multiplication symbols '*' only, representing a valid math expression of single digit numbers (e.g., 3+5*2). This expression was given to n elementary school students. The students were instructed to get the answer of the expression by following this order of operations:

Compute multiplication, reading from left to right; Then,
Compute addition, reading from left to right.

You are given an integer array answers of length n, which are the submitted answers of the students in no particular order. You are asked to grade the answers, by following these rules:

If an answer equals the correct answer of the expression, this student will be rewarded 5 points;
Otherwise, if the answer could be interpreted as if the student applied the operators in the wrong order but had correct arithmetic, this student will be rewarded 2 points;
Otherwise, this student will be rewarded 0 points.

Return the sum of the points of the students.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""7+3*1*2"", answers = [20,13,42]
Output: 7
Explanation: As illustrated above, the correct answer of the expression is 13, therefore one student is rewarded 5 points: [20,13,42]
A student might have applied the operators in this wrong order: ((7+3)*1)*2 = 20. Therefore one student is rewarded 2 points: [20,13,42]
The points for the students are: [2,5,0]. The sum of the points is 2+5+0=7.

Example 2:
Input: s = ""3+5*2"", answers = [13,0,10,13,13,16,16]
Output: 19
Explanation: The correct answer of the expression is 13, therefore three students are rewarded 5 points each: [13,0,10,13,13,16,16]
A student might have applied the operators in this wrong order: ((3+5)*2 = 16. Therefore two students are rewarded 2 points: [13,0,10,13,13,16,16]
The points for the students are: [5,0,0,5,5,2,2]. The sum of the points is 5+0+0+5+5+2+2=19.

Example 3:
Input: s = ""6+0*1"", answers = [12,9,6,4,8,6]
Output: 10
Explanation: The correct answer of the expression is 6.
If a student had incorrectly done (6+0)*1, the answer would also be 6.
By the rules of grading, the students will still be rewarded 5 points (as they got the correct answer), not 2 points.
The points for the students are: [0,0,5,0,0,5]. The sum of the points is 10.

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each turn, the player may remove any stone from stones. The player who removes a stone loses if the sum of the values of all removed stones is divisible by 3. Bob will win automatically if there are no remaining stones (even if it is Alice's turn).
Assuming both players play optimally, return true if Alice wins and false if Bob wins.
 
Example 1:
Input: stones = [2,1]
Output: true
Explanation: The game will be played as follows:
- Turn 1: Alice can remove either stone.
- Turn 2: Bob removes the remaining stone. 
The sum of the removed stones is 1 + 2 = 3 and is divisible by 3. Therefore, Bob loses and Alice wins the game.

Example 2:
Input: stones = [2]
Output: false
Explanation: Alice will remove the only stone, and the sum of the values on the removed stones is 2. 
Since all the stones are removed and the sum of values is not divisible by 3, Bob wins the game.

Example 3:
Input: stones = [5,1,2,4,3]
Output: false
Explanation: Bob will always win. One possible way for Bob to win is shown below:
- Turn 1: Alice can remove the second stone with value 1. Sum of removed stones = 1.
- Turn 2: Bob removes the fifth stone with value 3. Sum of removed stones = 1 + 3 = 4.
- Turn 3: Alices removes the fourth stone with value 4. Sum of removed stones = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8.
- Turn 4: Bob removes the third stone with value 2. Sum of removed stones = 1 + 3 + 4 + 2 = 10.
- Turn 5: Alice removes the first stone with value 5. Sum of removed stones = 1 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 5 = 15.

2034,41,False,2034. Stock Price Fluctuation ,"You are given a stream of records about a particular stock. Each record contains a timestamp and the corresponding price of the stock at that timestamp.
Unfortunately due to the volatile nature of the stock market, the records do not come in order. Even worse, some records may be incorrect. Another record with the same timestamp may appear later in the stream correcting the price of the previous wrong record.
Design an algorithm that:

Updates the price of the stock at a particular timestamp, correcting the price from any previous records at the timestamp.
Finds the latest price of the stock based on the current records. The latest price is the price at the latest timestamp recorded.
Finds the maximum price the stock has been based on the current records.
Finds the minimum price the stock has been based on the current records.

Implement the StockPrice class:

StockPrice() Initializes the object with no price records.
void update(int timestamp, int price) Updates the price of the stock at the given timestamp.
int current() Returns the latest price of the stock.

Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take alternating turns removing pieces from the line. In this game, Alice moves first.

Alice is only allowed to remove a piece colored 'A' if both its neighbors are also colored 'A'. She is not allowed to remove pieces that are colored 'B'.
Bob is only allowed to remove a piece colored 'B' if both its neighbors are also colored 'B'. He is not allowed to remove pieces that are colored 'A'.
Alice and Bob cannot remove pieces from the edge of the line.
If a player cannot make a move on their turn, that player loses and the other player wins.

Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return true if Alice wins, or return false if Bob wins.
 
Example 1:
Input: colors = ""AAABABB""
Output: true
Explanation:
AAABABB -> AABABB
Alice moves first.
She removes the second 'A' from the left since that is the only 'A' whose neighbors are both 'A'.

Now it's Bob's turn.
Bob cannot make a move on his turn since there are no 'B's whose neighbors are both 'B'.
Thus, Alice wins, so return true.

Example 2:
Input: colors = ""AA""
Output: false
Explanation:
Alice has her turn first.
There are only two 'A's and both are on the edge of the line, so she cannot move on her turn.
Thus, Bob wins, so return false.

Example 3:

You are given a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates there is a message channel between servers ui and vi, and they can pass any number of messages to each other directly in one second. You are also given a 0-indexed integer array patience of length n.
All servers are connected, i.e., a message can be passed from one server to any other server(s) directly or indirectly through the message channels.
The server labeled 0 is the master server. The rest are data servers. Each data server needs to send its message to the master server for processing and wait for a reply. Messages move between servers optimally, so every message takes the least amount of time to arrive at the master server. The master server will process all newly arrived messages instantly and send a reply to the originating server via the reversed path the message had gone through.
At the beginning of second 0, each data server sends its message to be processed. Starting from second 1, at the beginning of every second, each data server will check if it has received a reply to the message it sent (including any newly arrived replies) from the master server:

If it has not, it will resend the message periodically. The data server i will resend the message every patience[i] second(s), i.e., the data server i will resend the message if patience[i] second(s) have elapsed since the last time the message was sent from this server.
Otherwise, no more resending will occur from this server.

The network becomes idle when there are no messages passing between servers or arriving at servers.
Return the earliest second starting from which the network becomes idle.
 
Example 1:

Input: edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], patience = [0,2,1]
Output: 8
Explanation:
At (the beginning of) second 0,
- Data server 1 sends its message (denoted 1A) to the master server.
- Data server 2 sends its message (denoted 2A) to the master server.

At second 1,
- Message 1A arrives at the master server. Master server processes message 1A instantly and sends a reply 1A back.
- Server 1 has not received any reply. 1 second (1 < patience[1] = 2) elapsed since this server has sent the message, therefore it does not resend the message.
- Server 2 has not received any reply. 1 second (1 == patience[2] = 1) elapsed since this server has sent the message, therefore it resends the message (denoted 2B).

At second 2,
- The reply 1A arrives at server 1. No more resending will occur from server 1.
- Message 2A arrives at the master server. Master server processes message 2A instantly and sends a reply 2A back.
- Server 2 resends the message (denoted 2C).
...
At second 4,
- The reply 2A arrives at server 2. No more resending will occur from server 2.
...
At second 7, reply 2D arrives at server 2.

Starting from the beginning of the second 8, there are no messages passing between servers or arriving at servers.
This is the time when the network becomes idle.

Example 2:

Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2]], patience = [0,10,10]

A node is a local maxima if the current node has a value strictly greater than the previous node and the next node.
A node is a local minima if the current node has a value strictly smaller than the previous node and the next node.
Note that a node can only be a local maxima/minima if there exists both a previous node and a next node.

Output: [-1,-1]
Explanation: There are no critical points in [3,1].

Example 2:

Input: head = [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]

Arbitrarily choose some elements (possibly none) of the sequence, and replace each with its length (as a numeric string).
Concatenate the sequence as the encoded string.

For example, one way to encode an original string ""abcdefghijklmnop"" might be:

Split it as a sequence: [""ab"", ""cdefghijklmn"", ""o"", ""p""].
Choose the second and third elements to be replaced by their lengths, respectively. The sequence becomes [""ab"", ""12"", ""1"", ""p""].

There are m product types of varying amounts, which are given as a 0-indexed integer array quantities, where quantities[i] represents the number of products of the ith product type.
You need to distribute all products to the retail stores following these rules:

A store can only be given at most one product type but can be given any amount of it.
After distribution, each store will have been given some number of products (possibly 0). Let x represent the maximum number of products given to any store. You want x to be as small as possible, i.e., you want to minimize the maximum number of products that are given to any store.

Return the minimum possible x.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 6, quantities = [11,6]

The grid is aligned with the four cardinal directions (""North"", ""East"", ""South"", and ""West""). A robot is initially at cell (0, 0) facing direction ""East"".
The robot can be instructed to move for a specific number of steps. For each step, it does the following.

Attempts to move forward one cell in the direction it is facing.
If the cell the robot is moving to is out of bounds, the robot instead turns 90 degrees counterclockwise and retries the step.

After the robot finishes moving the number of steps required, it stops and awaits the next instruction.
Implement the Robot class:

Robot(int width, int height) Initializes the width x height grid with the robot at (0, 0) facing ""East"".
void step(int num) Instructs the robot to move forward num steps.

The blue arrows depict how originalText is placed in the matrix, and the red arrows denote the order in which encodedText is formed. In the above example, encodedText = ""ch ie pr"".
Given the encoded string encodedText and number of rows rows, return the original string originalText.
Note: originalText does not have any trailing spaces ' '. The test cases are generated such that there is only one possible originalText.
 
Example 1:
Input: encodedText = ""ch   ie   pr"", rows = 3
Output: ""cipher""
Explanation: This is the same example described in the problem description.

Example 2:

Input: encodedText = ""iveo    eed   l te   olc"", rows = 4
Output: ""i love leetcode""
Explanation: The figure above denotes the matrix that was used to encode originalText. 
The blue arrows show how we can find originalText from encodedText.

Example 3:

Input: encodedText = ""coding"", rows = 1
Output: ""coding""
Explanation: Since there is only 1 row, both originalText and encodedText are the same.

2076,42,False,2076. Process Restricted Friend Requests,"You are given an integer n indicating the number of people in a network. Each person is labeled from 0 to n - 1.
You are also given a 0-indexed 2D integer array restrictions, where restrictions[i] = [xi, yi] means that person xi and person yi cannot become friends, either directly or indirectly through other people.
Initially, no one is friends with each other. You are given a list of friend requests as a 0-indexed 2D integer array requests, where requests[j] = [uj, vj] is a friend request between person uj and person vj.
A friend request is successful if uj and vj can be friends. Each friend request is processed in the given order (i.e., requests[j] occurs before requests[j + 1]), and upon a successful request, uj and vj become direct friends for all future friend requests.
Return a boolean array result, where each result[j] is true if the jth friend request is successful or false if it is not.
Note: If uj and vj are already direct friends, the request is still successful.
 
Example 1:

Each plant needs a specific amount of water. You will water the plants in the following way:

Water the plants in order from left to right.
After watering the current plant, if you do not have enough water to completely water the next plant, return to the river to fully refill the watering can.
You cannot refill the watering can early.

You are initially at the river (i.e., x = -1). It takes one step to move one unit on the x-axis.
Given a 0-indexed integer array plants of n integers, where plants[i] is the amount of water the ith plant needs, and an integer capacity representing the watering can capacity, return the number of steps needed to water all the plants.

- The sum of the subarray centered at index 3 with radius 3 is: 7 + 4 + 3 + 9 + 1 + 8 + 5 = 37.
  Using integer division, avg[3] = 37 / 7 = 5.
- For the subarray centered at index 4, avg[4] = (4 + 3 + 9 + 1 + 8 + 5 + 2) / 7 = 4.
- For the subarray centered at index 5, avg[5] = (3 + 9 + 1 + 8 + 5 + 2 + 6) / 7 = 4.
- avg[6], avg[7], and avg[8] are -1 because there are less than k elements after each index.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [100000], k = 0
Output: [100000]
Explanation:
- The sum of the subarray centered at index 0 with radius 0 is: 100000.
  avg[0] = 100000 / 1 = 100000.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [8], k = 100000
Output: [-1]
Explanation: 
- avg[0] is -1 because there are less than k elements before and after index 0.

2091,42,False,2091. Removing Minimum and Maximum From Array,"You are given a 0-indexed array of distinct integers nums.
There is an element in nums that has the lowest value and an element that has the highest value. We call them the minimum and maximum respectively. Your goal is to remove both these elements from the array.
A deletion is defined as either removing an element from the front of the array or removing an element from the back of the array.
Return the minimum number of deletions it would take to remove both the minimum and maximum element from the array.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,10,7,5,4,1,8,6]
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The minimum element in the array is nums[5], which is 1.
The maximum element in the array is nums[1], which is 10.
We can remove both the minimum and maximum by removing 2 elements from the front and 3 elements from the back.
This results in 2 + 3 = 5 deletions, which is the minimum number possible.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,-4,19,1,8,-2,-3,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
The minimum element in the array is nums[1], which is -4.
The maximum element in the array is nums[2], which is 19.
We can remove both the minimum and maximum by removing 3 elements from the front.
This results in only 3 deletions, which is the minimum number possible.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [101]

Explanation:  
There is only one element in the array, which makes it both the minimum and maximum element.
We can remove it with 1 deletion.

2092,42,False,2092. Find All People With Secret,"You are given an integer n indicating there are n people numbered from 0 to n - 1. You are also given a 0-indexed 2D integer array meetings where meetings[i] = [xi, yi, timei] indicates that person xi and person yi have a meeting at timei. A person may attend multiple meetings at the same time. Finally, you are given an integer firstPerson.
Person 0 has a secret and initially shares the secret with a person firstPerson at time 0. This secret is then shared every time a meeting takes place with a person that has the secret. More formally, for every meeting, if a person xi has the secret at timei, then they will share the secret with person yi, and vice versa.
The secrets are shared instantaneously. That is, a person may receive the secret and share it with people in other meetings within the same time frame.
Return a list of all the people that have the secret after all the meetings have taken place. You may return the answer in any order.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 6, meetings = [[1,2,5],[2,3,8],[1,5,10]], firstPerson = 1
Output: [0,1,2,3,5]
Explanation:
At time 0, person 0 shares the secret with person 1.
At time 5, person 1 shares the secret with person 2.
At time 8, person 2 shares the secret with person 3.
At time 10, person 1 shares the secret with person 5.​​​​
Thus, people 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 know the secret after all the meetings.

Example 2:
Input: n = 4, meetings = [[3,1,3],[1,2,2],[0,3,3]], firstPerson = 3
Output: [0,1,3]
Explanation:
At time 0, person 0 shares the secret with person 3.
At time 2, neither person 1 nor person 2 know the secret.
At time 3, person 3 shares the secret with person 0 and person 1.
Thus, people 0, 1, and 3 know the secret after all the meetings.

Example 3:
Input: n = 5, meetings = [[3,4,2],[1,2,1],[2,3,1]], firstPerson = 1
Output: [0,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
At time 0, person 0 shares the secret with person 1.
At time 1, person 1 shares the secret with person 2, and person 2 shares the secret with person 3.
Note that person 2 can share the secret at the same time as receiving it.
At time 2, person 3 shares the secret with person 4.

You are given a 0-indexed integer array security, where security[i] is the number of guards on duty on the ith day. The days are numbered starting from 0. You are also given an integer time.
The ith day is a good day to rob the bank if:

There are at least time days before and after the ith day,
The number of guards at the bank for the time days before i are non-increasing, and
The number of guards at the bank for the time days after i are non-decreasing.

More formally, this means day i is a good day to rob the bank if and only if security[i - time] >= security[i - time + 1] >= ... >= security[i] <= ... <= security[i + time - 1] <= security[i + time].
Return a list of all days (0-indexed) that are good days to rob the bank. The order that the days are returned in does not matter.
 
Example 1:
Input: security = [5,3,3,3,5,6,2], time = 2
Output: [2,3]
Explanation:
On day 2, we have security[0] >= security[1] >= security[2] <= security[3] <= security[4].
On day 3, we have security[1] >= security[2] >= security[3] <= security[4] <= security[5].
No other days satisfy this condition, so days 2 and 3 are the only good days to rob the bank.

Example 2:
Input: security = [1,1,1,1,1], time = 0

The bombs are represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array bombs where bombs[i] = [xi, yi, ri]. xi and yi denote the X-coordinate and Y-coordinate of the location of the ith bomb, whereas ri denotes the radius of its range.
You may choose to detonate a single bomb. When a bomb is detonated, it will detonate all bombs that lie in its range. These bombs will further detonate the bombs that lie in their ranges.
Given the list of bombs, return the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated if you are allowed to detonate only one bomb.
 
Example 1:

Input: bombs = [[2,1,3],[6,1,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The above figure shows the positions and ranges of the 2 bombs.
If we detonate the left bomb, the right bomb will not be affected.
But if we detonate the right bomb, both bombs will be detonated.
So the maximum bombs that can be detonated is max(1, 2) = 2.

Example 2:

Input: bombs = [[1,1,5],[10,10,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Detonating either bomb will not detonate the other bomb, so the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated is 1.

Example 3:

Input: bombs = [[1,2,3],[2,3,1],[3,4,2],[4,5,3],[5,6,4]]
Output: 5
Explanation:
The best bomb to detonate is bomb 0 because:
- Bomb 0 detonates bombs 1 and 2. The red circle denotes the range of bomb 0.

Input: rings = ""B0B6G0R6R0R6G9""
Output: 1
Explanation: 
- The rod labeled 0 holds 3 rings with all colors: red, green, and blue.
- The rod labeled 6 holds 3 rings, but it only has red and blue.
- The rod labeled 9 holds only a green ring.
Thus, the number of rods with all three colors is 1.

Example 2:

Input: rings = ""B0R0G0R9R0B0G0""
Output: 1
Explanation: 
- The rod labeled 0 holds 6 rings with all colors: red, green, and blue.
- The rod labeled 9 holds only a red ring.
Thus, the number of rods with all three colors is 1.

Example 3:
Input: rings = ""G4""

2104,43,False,2104. Sum of Subarray Ranges,"You are given an integer array nums. The range of a subarray of nums is the difference between the largest and smallest element in the subarray.
Return the sum of all subarray ranges of nums.
A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: The 6 subarrays of nums are the following:
[1], range = largest - smallest = 1 - 1 = 0 
[2], range = 2 - 2 = 0
[3], range = 3 - 3 = 0
[1,2], range = 2 - 1 = 1
[2,3], range = 3 - 2 = 1
[1,2,3], range = 3 - 1 = 2
So the sum of all ranges is 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,3,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: The 6 subarrays of nums are the following:
[1], range = largest - smallest = 1 - 1 = 0
[3], range = 3 - 3 = 0
[3], range = 3 - 3 = 0
[1,3], range = 3 - 1 = 2
[3,3], range = 3 - 3 = 0
[1,3,3], range = 3 - 1 = 2
So the sum of all ranges is 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 4.

2105,43,False,2105. Watering Plants II,"Alice and Bob want to water n plants in their garden. The plants are arranged in a row and are labeled from 0 to n - 1 from left to right where the ith plant is located at x = i.
Each plant needs a specific amount of water. Alice and Bob have a watering can each, initially full. They water the plants in the following way:

Alice waters the plants in order from left to right, starting from the 0th plant. Bob waters the plants in order from right to left, starting from the (n - 1)th plant. They begin watering the plants simultaneously.
It takes the same amount of time to water each plant regardless of how much water it needs.
Alice/Bob must water the plant if they have enough in their can to fully water it. Otherwise, they first refill their can (instantaneously) then water the plant.
In case both Alice and Bob reach the same plant, the one with more water currently in his/her watering can should water this plant. If they have the same amount of water, then Alice should water this plant.

Given a 0-indexed integer array plants of n integers, where plants[i] is the amount of water the ith plant needs, and two integers capacityA and capacityB representing the capacities of Alice's and Bob's watering cans respectively, return the number of times they have to refill to water all the plants.
 
Example 1:
Input: plants = [2,2,3,3], capacityA = 5, capacityB = 5
Output: 1
Explanation:
- Initially, Alice and Bob have 5 units of water each in their watering cans.
- Alice waters plant 0, Bob waters plant 3.
- Alice and Bob now have 3 units and 2 units of water respectively.
- Alice has enough water for plant 1, so she waters it. Bob does not have enough water for plant 2, so he refills his can then waters it.
So, the total number of times they have to refill to water all the plants is 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 1.

Example 2:
Input: plants = [2,2,3,3], capacityA = 3, capacityB = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
- Initially, Alice and Bob have 3 units and 4 units of water in their watering cans respectively.
- Alice waters plant 0, Bob waters plant 3.
- Alice and Bob now have 1 unit of water each, and need to water plants 1 and 2 respectively.
- Since neither of them have enough water for their current plants, they refill their cans and then water the plants.
So, the total number of times they have to refill to water all the plants is 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 2.

Example 3:
Input: plants = [5], capacityA = 10, capacityB = 8
Output: 0
Explanation:
- There is only one plant.
- Alice's watering can has 10 units of water, whereas Bob's can has 8 units. Since Alice has more water in her can, she waters this plant.
So, the total number of times they have to refill is 0.

2106,43,False,2106. Maximum Fruits Harvested After at Most K Steps,"Fruits are available at some positions on an infinite x-axis. You are given a 2D integer array fruits where fruits[i] = [positioni, amounti] depicts amounti fruits at the position positioni. fruits is already sorted by positioni in ascending order, and each positioni is unique.
You are also given an integer startPos and an integer k. Initially, you are at the position startPos. From any position, you can either walk to the left or right. It takes one step to move one unit on the x-axis, and you can walk at most k steps in total. For every position you reach, you harvest all the fruits at that position, and the fruits will disappear from that position.
Return the maximum total number of fruits you can harvest.
 
Example 1:

Input: fruits = [[2,8],[6,3],[8,6]], startPos = 5, k = 4
Output: 9
Explanation: 
The optimal way is to:
- Move right to position 6 and harvest 3 fruits
- Move right to position 8 and harvest 6 fruits
You moved 3 steps and harvested 3 + 6 = 9 fruits in total.

Example 2:

Input: fruits = [[0,9],[4,1],[5,7],[6,2],[7,4],[10,9]], startPos = 5, k = 4
Output: 14
Explanation: 
You can move at most k = 4 steps, so you cannot reach position 0 nor 10.
The optimal way is to:
- Harvest the 7 fruits at the starting position 5
- Move left to position 4 and harvest 1 fruit
- Move right to position 6 and harvest 2 fruits
- Move right to position 7 and harvest 4 fruits
You moved 1 + 3 = 4 steps and harvested 7 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 14 fruits in total.

2111,43,False,2111. Minimum Operations to Make the Array K-Increasing,"You are given a 0-indexed array arr consisting of n positive integers, and a positive integer k.
The array arr is called K-increasing if arr[i-k] <= arr[i] holds for every index i, where k <= i <= n-1.

For example, arr = [4, 1, 5, 2, 6, 2] is K-increasing for k = 2 because:

	
arr[0] <= arr[2] (4 <= 5)
arr[1] <= arr[3] (1 <= 2)
arr[2] <= arr[4] (5 <= 6)
arr[3] <= arr[5] (2 <= 2)


However, the same arr is not K-increasing for k = 1 (because arr[0] > arr[1]) or k = 3 (because arr[0] > arr[3]).

In one operation, you can choose an index i and change arr[i] into any positive integer.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array K-increasing for the given k.
 
Example 1:
Input: arr = [5,4,3,2,1], k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation:
For k = 1, the resultant array has to be non-decreasing.
Some of the K-increasing arrays that can be formed are [5,6,7,8,9], [1,1,1,1,1], [2,2,3,4,4]. All of them require 4 operations.
It is suboptimal to change the array to, for example, [6,7,8,9,10] because it would take 5 operations.
It can be shown that we cannot make the array K-increasing in less than 4 operations.

Example 2:
Input: arr = [4,1,5,2,6,2], k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation:
This is the same example as the one in the problem description.
Here, for every index i where 2 <= i <= 5, arr[i-2] <= arr[i].
Since the given array is already K-increasing, we do not need to perform any operations.
Example 3:
Input: arr = [4,1,5,2,6,2], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
Indices 3 and 5 are the only ones not satisfying arr[i-3] <= arr[i] for 3 <= i <= 5.
One of the ways we can make the array K-increasing is by changing arr[3] to 4 and arr[5] to 5.
The array will now be [4,1,5,4,6,5].
Note that there can be other ways to make the array K-increasing, but none of them require less than 2 operations.

2117,43,False,2117. Abbreviating the Product of a Range,"You are given two positive integers left and right with left <= right. Calculate the product of all integers in the inclusive range [left, right].
Since the product may be very large, you will abbreviate it following these steps:

Count all trailing zeros in the product and remove them. Let us denote this count as C.

	
For example, there are 3 trailing zeros in 1000, and there are 0 trailing zeros in 546.


Denote the remaining number of digits in the product as d. If d > 10, then express the product as <pre>...<suf> where <pre> denotes the first 5 digits of the product, and <suf> denotes the last 5 digits of the product after removing all trailing zeros. If d <= 10, we keep it unchanged.
	
For example, we express 1234567654321 as 12345...54321, but 1234567 is represented as 1234567.


Finally, represent the product as a string ""<pre>...<suf>eC"".
	
For example, 12345678987600000 will be represented as ""12345...89876e5"".



Return a string denoting the abbreviated product of all integers in the inclusive range [left, right].
 
Example 1:
Input: left = 1, right = 4
Output: ""24e0""
Explanation: The product is 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 = 24.
There are no trailing zeros, so 24 remains the same. The abbreviation will end with ""e0"".
Since the number of digits is 2, which is less than 10, we do not have to abbreviate it further.
Thus, the final representation is ""24e0"".

Example 2:
Input: left = 2, right = 11
Output: ""399168e2""
Explanation: The product is 39916800.
There are 2 trailing zeros, which we remove to get 399168. The abbreviation will end with ""e2"".
The number of digits after removing the trailing zeros is 6, so we do not abbreviate it further.
Hence, the abbreviated product is ""399168e2"".

2120,43,False,2120. Execution of All Suffix Instructions Staying in a Grid,"There is an n x n grid, with the top-left cell at (0, 0) and the bottom-right cell at (n - 1, n - 1). You are given the integer n and an integer array startPos where startPos = [startrow, startcol] indicates that a robot is initially at cell (startrow, startcol).
You are also given a 0-indexed string s of length m where s[i] is the ith instruction for the robot: 'L' (move left), 'R' (move right), 'U' (move up), and 'D' (move down).
The robot can begin executing from any ith instruction in s. It executes the instructions one by one towards the end of s but it stops if either of these conditions is met:

The next instruction will move the robot off the grid.
There are no more instructions left to execute.

Return an array answer of length m where answer[i] is the number of instructions the robot can execute if the robot begins executing from the ith instruction in s.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 3, startPos = [0,1], s = ""RRDDLU""
Output: [1,5,4,3,1,0]
Explanation: Starting from startPos and beginning execution from the ith instruction:
- 0th: ""RRDDLU"". Only one instruction ""R"" can be executed before it moves off the grid.
- 1st:  ""RDDLU"". All five instructions can be executed while it stays in the grid and ends at (1, 1).
- 2nd:   ""DDLU"". All four instructions can be executed while it stays in the grid and ends at (1, 0).
- 3rd:    ""DLU"". All three instructions can be executed while it stays in the grid and ends at (0, 0).
- 4th:     ""LU"". Only one instruction ""L"" can be executed before it moves off the grid.
- 5th:      ""U"". If moving up, it would move off the grid.

The interval between two elements in arr is defined as the absolute difference between their indices. More formally, the interval between arr[i] and arr[j] is |i - j|.
Return an array intervals of length n where intervals[i] is the sum of intervals between arr[i] and each element in arr with the same value as arr[i].
Note: |x| is the absolute value of x.
 
Example 1:
Input: arr = [2,1,3,1,2,3,3]
Output: [4,2,7,2,4,4,5]
Explanation:
- Index 0: Another 2 is found at index 4. |0 - 4| = 4
- Index 1: Another 1 is found at index 3. |1 - 3| = 2
- Index 2: Two more 3s are found at indices 5 and 6. |2 - 5| + |2 - 6| = 7
- Index 3: Another 1 is found at index 1. |3 - 1| = 2

2122,43,False,2122. Recover the Original Array,"Alice had a 0-indexed array arr consisting of n positive integers. She chose an arbitrary positive integer k and created two new 0-indexed integer arrays lower and higher in the following manner:

lower[i] = arr[i] - k, for every index i where 0 <= i < n
higher[i] = arr[i] + k, for every index i where 0 <= i < n

Unfortunately, Alice lost all three arrays. However, she remembers the integers that were present in the arrays lower and higher, but not the array each integer belonged to. Help Alice and recover the original array.
Given an array nums consisting of 2n integers, where exactly n of the integers were present in lower and the remaining in higher, return the original array arr. In case the answer is not unique, return any valid array.
Note: The test cases are generated such that there exists at least one valid array arr.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,10,6,4,8,12]
Output: [3,7,11]
Explanation:
If arr = [3,7,11] and k = 1, we get lower = [2,6,10] and higher = [4,8,12].
Combining lower and higher gives us [2,6,10,4,8,12], which is a permutation of nums.
Another valid possibility is that arr = [5,7,9] and k = 3. In that case, lower = [2,4,6] and higher = [8,10,12]. 

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,1,3,3]
Output: [2,2]
Explanation:
If arr = [2,2] and k = 1, we get lower = [1,1] and higher = [3,3].
Combining lower and higher gives us [1,1,3,3], which is equal to nums.
Note that arr cannot be [1,3] because in that case, the only possible way to obtain [1,1,3,3] is with k = 0.
This is invalid since k must be positive.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [5,435]
Output: [220]
Explanation:
The only possible combination is arr = [220] and k = 215. Using them, we get lower = [5] and higher = [435].

You are given a 0-indexed binary string array bank representing the floor plan of the bank, which is an m x n 2D matrix. bank[i] represents the ith row, consisting of '0's and '1's. '0' means the cell is empty, while'1' means the cell has a security device.
There is one laser beam between any two security devices if both conditions are met:

The two devices are located on two different rows: r1 and r2, where r1 < r2.
For each row i where r1 < i < r2, there are no security devices in the ith row.

Laser beams are independent, i.e., one beam does not interfere nor join with another.
Return the total number of laser beams in the bank.
 
Example 1:

Input: bank = [""011001"",""000000"",""010100"",""001000""]

Explanation: Between each of the following device pairs, there is one beam. In total, there are 8 beams:

 * bank[0][1] -- bank[2][3]
 * bank[0][2] -- bank[2][1]

 * bank[0][5] -- bank[2][3]
 * bank[2][1] -- bank[3][2]
 * bank[2][3] -- bank[3][2]
Note that there is no beam between any device on the 0th row with any on the 3rd row.
This is because the 2nd row contains security devices, which breaks the second condition.

You can arrange for the planet to collide with the asteroids in any arbitrary order. If the mass of the planet is greater than or equal to the mass of the asteroid, the asteroid is destroyed and the planet gains the mass of the asteroid. Otherwise, the planet is destroyed.
Return true if all asteroids can be destroyed. Otherwise, return false.
 
Example 1:
Input: mass = 10, asteroids = [3,9,19,5,21]
Output: true
Explanation: One way to order the asteroids is [9,19,5,3,21]:
- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 9. New planet mass: 10 + 9 = 19
- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 19. New planet mass: 19 + 19 = 38
- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 5. New planet mass: 38 + 5 = 43
- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 3. New planet mass: 43 + 3 = 46
- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 21. New planet mass: 46 + 21 = 67
All asteroids are destroyed.

Example 2:
Input: mass = 5, asteroids = [4,9,23,4]
Output: false
Explanation: 
The planet cannot ever gain enough mass to destroy the asteroid with a mass of 23.
After the planet destroys the other asteroids, it will have a mass of 5 + 4 + 9 + 4 = 22.
This is less than 23, so a collision would not destroy the last asteroid.

Given a 0-indexed integer array favorite, where favorite[i] denotes the favorite person of the ith employee, return the maximum number of employees that can be invited to the meeting.
 
Example 1:

Input: favorite = [2,2,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The above figure shows how the company can invite employees 0, 1, and 2, and seat them at the round table.
All employees cannot be invited because employee 2 cannot sit beside employees 0, 1, and 3, simultaneously.
Note that the company can also invite employees 1, 2, and 3, and give them their desired seats.
The maximum number of employees that can be invited to the meeting is 3. 

Example 2:
Input: favorite = [1,2,0]

Explanation: 
Each employee is the favorite person of at least one other employee, and the only way the company can invite them is if they invite every employee.
The seating arrangement will be the same as that in the figure given in example 1:
- Employee 0 will sit between employees 2 and 1.
- Employee 1 will sit between employees 0 and 2.
- Employee 2 will sit between employees 1 and 0.
The maximum number of employees that can be invited to the meeting is 3.

Explanation:
The above figure shows how the company will invite employees 0, 1, 3, and 4, and seat them at the round table.

[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1] using 2 swaps (using the circular property of the array).
[1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0] using 2 swaps.
There is no way to group all 1's together with 0 or 1 swaps.
Thus, the minimum number of swaps required is 2.

Example 3:

2135,43,False,2135. Count Words Obtained After Adding a Letter,"You are given two 0-indexed arrays of strings startWords and targetWords. Each string consists of lowercase English letters only.
For each string in targetWords, check if it is possible to choose a string from startWords and perform a conversion operation on it to be equal to that from targetWords.
The conversion operation is described in the following two steps:

Append any lowercase letter that is not present in the string to its end.

	
For example, if the string is ""abc"", the letters 'd', 'e', or 'y' can be added to it, but not 'a'. If 'd' is added, the resulting string will be ""abcd"".


Rearrange the letters of the new string in any arbitrary order.
	
For example, ""abcd"" can be rearranged to ""acbd"", ""bacd"", ""cbda"", and so on. Note that it can also be rearranged to ""abcd"" itself.



Return the number of strings in targetWords that can be obtained by performing the operations on any string of startWords.
Note that you will only be verifying if the string in targetWords can be obtained from a string in startWords by performing the operations. The strings in startWords do not actually change during this process.
 
Example 1:
Input: startWords = [""ant"",""act"",""tack""], targetWords = [""tack"",""act"",""acti""]
Output: 2
Explanation:
- In order to form targetWords[0] = ""tack"", we use startWords[1] = ""act"", append 'k' to it, and rearrange ""actk"" to ""tack"".
- There is no string in startWords that can be used to obtain targetWords[1] = ""act"".
  Note that ""act"" does exist in startWords, but we must append one letter to the string before rearranging it.
- In order to form targetWords[2] = ""acti"", we use startWords[1] = ""act"", append 'i' to it, and rearrange ""acti"" to ""acti"" itself.

Example 2:
Input: startWords = [""ab"",""a""], targetWords = [""abc"",""abcd""]
Output: 1
Explanation:
- In order to form targetWords[0] = ""abc"", we use startWords[0] = ""ab"", add 'c' to it, and rearrange it to ""abc"".
- There is no string in startWords that can be used to obtain targetWords[1] = ""abcd"".

Planting a seed takes time and so does the growth of a seed. You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays plantTime and growTime, of length n each:

plantTime[i] is the number of full days it takes you to plant the ith seed. Every day, you can work on planting exactly one seed. You do not have to work on planting the same seed on consecutive days, but the planting of a seed is not complete until you have worked plantTime[i] days on planting it in total.
growTime[i] is the number of full days it takes the ith seed to grow after being completely planted. After the last day of its growth, the flower blooms and stays bloomed forever.

From the beginning of day 0, you can plant the seeds in any order.
Return the earliest possible day where all seeds are blooming.
 
Example 1:

Input: plantTime = [1,4,3], growTime = [2,3,1]
Output: 9
Explanation: The grayed out pots represent planting days, colored pots represent growing days, and the flower represents the day it blooms.
One optimal way is:
On day 0, plant the 0th seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 3.
On days 1, 2, 3, and 4, plant the 1st seed. The seed grows for 3 full days and blooms on day 8.
On days 5, 6, and 7, plant the 2nd seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 9.
Thus, on day 9, all the seeds are blooming.

Example 2:

Input: plantTime = [1,2,3,2], growTime = [2,1,2,1]
Output: 9
Explanation: The grayed out pots represent planting days, colored pots represent growing days, and the flower represents the day it blooms.
One optimal way is:
On day 1, plant the 0th seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 4.
On days 0 and 3, plant the 1st seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 5.
On days 2, 4, and 5, plant the 2nd seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 8.
On days 6 and 7, plant the 3rd seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 9.
Thus, on day 9, all the seeds are blooming.

Example 3:
Input: plantTime = [1], growTime = [1]

2138,43,False,2138. Divide a String Into Groups of Size k,"A string s can be partitioned into groups of size k using the following procedure:

The first group consists of the first k characters of the string, the second group consists of the next k characters of the string, and so on. Each character can be a part of exactly one group.
For the last group, if the string does not have k characters remaining, a character fill is used to complete the group.

Note that the partition is done so that after removing the fill character from the last group (if it exists) and concatenating all the groups in order, the resultant string should be s.
Given the string s, the size of each group k and the character fill, return a string array denoting the composition of every group s has been divided into, using the above procedure.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""abcdefghi"", k = 3, fill = ""x""
Output: [""abc"",""def"",""ghi""]
Explanation:
The first 3 characters ""abc"" form the first group.
The next 3 characters ""def"" form the second group.
The last 3 characters ""ghi"" form the third group.
Since all groups can be completely filled by characters from the string, we do not need to use fill.
Thus, the groups formed are ""abc"", ""def"", and ""ghi"".

Example 2:
Input: s = ""abcdefghij"", k = 3, fill = ""x""
Output: [""abc"",""def"",""ghi"",""jxx""]
Explanation:
Similar to the previous example, we are forming the first three groups ""abc"", ""def"", and ""ghi"".
For the last group, we can only use the character 'j' from the string. To complete this group, we add 'x' twice.
Thus, the 4 groups formed are ""abc"", ""def"", ""ghi"", and ""jxx"".

The customer can choose any candy to take away for free as long as the cost of the chosen candy is less than or equal to the minimum cost of the two candies bought.

For example, if there are 4 candies with costs 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the customer buys candies with costs 2 and 3, they can take the candy with cost 1 for free, but not the candy with cost 4.

Given a 0-indexed integer array cost, where cost[i] denotes the cost of the ith candy, return the minimum cost of buying all the candies.
 
Example 1:
Input: cost = [1,2,3]

Explanation: We buy the candies with costs 2 and 3, and take the candy with cost 1 for free.
The total cost of buying all candies is 2 + 3 = 5. This is the only way we can buy the candies.
Note that we cannot buy candies with costs 1 and 3, and then take the candy with cost 2 for free.
The cost of the free candy has to be less than or equal to the minimum cost of the purchased candies.

0 represents a wall that you cannot pass through.
1 represents an empty cell that you can freely move to and from.
All other positive integers represent the price of an item in that cell. You may also freely move to and from these item cells.

It takes 1 step to travel between adjacent grid cells.
You are also given integer arrays pricing and start where pricing = [low, high] and start = [row, col] indicates that you start at the position (row, col) and are interested only in items with a price in the range of [low, high] (inclusive). You are further given an integer k.
You are interested in the positions of the k highest-ranked items whose prices are within the given price range. The rank is determined by the first of these criteria that is different:

Distance, defined as the length of the shortest path from the start (shorter distance has a higher rank).
Price (lower price has a higher rank, but it must be in the price range).
The row number (smaller row number has a higher rank).
The column number (smaller column number has a higher rank).

Return the k highest-ranked items within the price range sorted by their rank (highest to lowest). If there are fewer than k reachable items within the price range, return all of them.

Output: [[0,1],[1,1],[2,1]]
Explanation: You start at (0,0).
With a price range of [2,5], we can take items from (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) and (2,2).
The ranks of these items are:
- (0,1) with distance 1

With a price range of [2,3], we can take items from (0,1), (1,1), (1,2) and (2,1).
The ranks of these items are:
- (2,1) with distance 2, price 2
- (1,2) with distance 2, price 3
- (1,1) with distance 3
- (0,1) with distance 4
Thus, the 2 highest ranked items in the price range are (2,1) and (1,2).

Example 3:

Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[0,0,1],[2,3,4]], pricing = [2,3], start = [0,0], k = 3
Output: [[2,1],[2,0]]
Explanation: You start at (0,0).
With a price range of [2,3], we can take items from (2,0) and (2,1). 
The ranks of these items are: 
- (2,1) with distance 5

2149,43,False,2149. Rearrange Array Elements by Sign,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of even length consisting of an equal number of positive and negative integers.
You should rearrange the elements of nums such that the modified array follows the given conditions:

Every consecutive pair of integers have opposite signs.
For all integers with the same sign, the order in which they were present in nums is preserved.
The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.

Return the modified array after rearranging the elements to satisfy the aforementioned conditions.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,1,-2,-5,2,-4]
Output: [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4]
Explanation:
The positive integers in nums are [3,1,2]. The negative integers are [-2,-5,-4].
The only possible way to rearrange them such that they satisfy all conditions is [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4].
Other ways such as [1,-2,2,-5,3,-4], [3,1,2,-2,-5,-4], [-2,3,-5,1,-4,2] are incorrect because they do not satisfy one or more conditions.  

Example 2:

Explanation:
1 is the only positive integer and -1 the only negative integer in nums.
So nums is rearranged to [1,-1].

The good person: The person who always tells the truth.
The bad person: The person who might tell the truth and might lie.

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array statements of size n x n that represents the statements made by n people about each other. More specifically, statements[i][j] could be one of the following:

0 which represents a statement made by person i that person j is a bad person.
1 which represents a statement made by person i that person j is a good person.
2 represents that no statement is made by person i about person j.

Additionally, no person ever makes a statement about themselves. Formally, we have that statements[i][i] = 2 for all 0 <= i < n.
Return the maximum number of people who can be good based on the statements made by the n people.
 
Example 1:

Input: statements = [[2,1,2],[1,2,2],[2,0,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Each person makes a single statement.
- Person 0 states that person 1 is good.
- Person 1 states that person 0 is good.
- Person 2 states that person 1 is bad.
Let's take person 2 as the key.
- Assuming that person 2 is a good person:
    - Based on the statement made by person 2, person 1 is a bad person.
    - Now we know for sure that person 1 is bad and person 2 is good.
    - Based on the statement made by person 1, and since person 1 is bad, they could be:
        - telling the truth. There will be a contradiction in this case and this assumption is invalid.
        - lying. In this case, person 0 is also a bad person and lied in their statement.
    - Following that person 2 is a good person, there will be only one good person in the group.
- Assuming that person 2 is a bad person:
    - Based on the statement made by person 2, and since person 2 is bad, they could be:
        - telling the truth. Following this scenario, person 0 and 1 are both bad as explained before.
            - Following that person 2 is bad but told the truth, there will be no good persons in the group.
        - lying. In this case person 1 is a good person.
            - Since person 1 is a good person, person 0 is also a good person.
            - Following that person 2 is bad and lied, there will be two good persons in the group.
We can see that at most 2 persons are good in the best case, so we return 2.
Note that there is more than one way to arrive at this conclusion.

Example 2:

Input: statements = [[2,0],[0,2]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Each person makes a single statement.
- Person 0 states that person 1 is bad.
- Person 1 states that person 0 is bad.
Let's take person 0 as the key.
- Assuming that person 0 is a good person:
    - Based on the statement made by person 0, person 1 is a bad person and was lying.
    - Following that person 0 is a good person, there will be only one good person in the group.
- Assuming that person 0 is a bad person:
    - Based on the statement made by person 0, and since person 0 is bad, they could be:

Where val(s[i]) represents the index of s[i] in the alphabet from val('a') = 1 to val('z') = 26.
You are given a string s and the integers power, modulo, k, and hashValue. Return sub, the first substring of s of length k such that hash(sub, power, modulo) == hashValue.
The test cases will be generated such that an answer always exists.
A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""leetcode"", power = 7, modulo = 20, k = 2, hashValue = 0

Explanation: The hash of ""ee"" can be computed to be hash(""ee"", 7, 20) = (5 * 1 + 5 * 7) mod 20 = 40 mod 20 = 0. 
""ee"" is the first substring of length 2 with hashValue 0. Hence, we return ""ee"".

Example 2:
Input: s = ""fbxzaad"", power = 31, modulo = 100, k = 3, hashValue = 32

Return an array ans of size 2 where:

ans[0] is the maximum number of groups words can be divided into, and
ans[1] is the size of the largest group.

 
Example 1:
Input: words = [""a"",""b"",""ab"",""cde""]
Output: [2,3]
Explanation:
- words[0] can be used to obtain words[1] (by replacing 'a' with 'b'), and words[2] (by adding 'b'). So words[0] is connected to words[1] and words[2].
- words[1] can be used to obtain words[0] (by replacing 'b' with 'a'), and words[2] (by adding 'a'). So words[1] is connected to words[0] and words[2].
- words[2] can be used to obtain words[0] (by deleting 'b'), and words[1] (by deleting 'a'). So words[2] is connected to words[0] and words[1].
- words[3] is not connected to any string in words.
Thus, words can be divided into 2 groups [""a"",""b"",""ab""] and [""cde""]. The size of the largest group is 3.

at least 1 second.
at most 99 minutes and 99 seconds.

To set the cooking time, you push at most four digits. The microwave normalizes what you push as four digits by prepending zeroes. It interprets the first two digits as the minutes and the last two digits as the seconds. It then adds them up as the cooking time. For example,

You push 9 5 4 (three digits). It is normalized as 0954 and interpreted as 9 minutes and 54 seconds.
You push 0 0 0 8 (four digits). It is interpreted as 0 minutes and 8 seconds.
You push 8 0 9 0. It is interpreted as 80 minutes and 90 seconds.
You push 8 1 3 0. It is interpreted as 81 minutes and 30 seconds.

You are given integers startAt, moveCost, pushCost, and targetSeconds. Initially, your finger is on the digit startAt. Moving the finger above any specific digit costs moveCost units of fatigue. Pushing the digit below the finger once costs pushCost units of fatigue.
There can be multiple ways to set the microwave to cook for targetSeconds seconds but you are interested in the way with the minimum cost.
Return the minimum cost to set targetSeconds seconds of cooking time.
Remember that one minute consists of 60 seconds.
 
Example 1:

Input: startAt = 1, moveCost = 2, pushCost = 1, targetSeconds = 600
Output: 6
Explanation: The following are the possible ways to set the cooking time.
- 1 0 0 0, interpreted as 10 minutes and 0 seconds.
  The finger is already on digit 1, pushes 1 (with cost 1), moves to 0 (with cost 2), pushes 0 (with cost 1), pushes 0 (with cost 1), and pushes 0 (with cost 1).
  The cost is: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6. This is the minimum cost.
- 0 9 6 0, interpreted as 9 minutes and 60 seconds. That is also 600 seconds.
  The finger moves to 0 (with cost 2), pushes 0 (with cost 1), moves to 9 (with cost 2), pushes 9 (with cost 1), moves to 6 (with cost 2), pushes 6 (with cost 1), moves to 0 (with cost 2), and pushes 0 (with cost 1).
  The cost is: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 12.
- 9 6 0, normalized as 0960 and interpreted as 9 minutes and 60 seconds.
  The finger moves to 9 (with cost 2), pushes 9 (with cost 1), moves to 6 (with cost 2), pushes 6 (with cost 1), moves to 0 (with cost 2), and pushes 0 (with cost 1).
  The cost is: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 9.

Example 2:

Input: startAt = 0, moveCost = 1, pushCost = 2, targetSeconds = 76
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal way is to push two digits: 7 6, interpreted as 76 seconds.
The finger moves to 7 (with cost 1), pushes 7 (with cost 2), moves to 6 (with cost 1), and pushes 6 (with cost 2). The total cost is: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6

2163,44,False,2163. Minimum Difference in Sums After Removal of Elements,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums consisting of 3 * n elements.
You are allowed to remove any subsequence of elements of size exactly n from nums. The remaining 2 * n elements will be divided into two equal parts:

The first n elements belonging to the first part and their sum is sumfirst.
The next n elements belonging to the second part and their sum is sumsecond.

The difference in sums of the two parts is denoted as sumfirst - sumsecond.

For example, if sumfirst = 3 and sumsecond = 2, their difference is 1.
Similarly, if sumfirst = 2 and sumsecond = 3, their difference is -1.

Return the minimum difference possible between the sums of the two parts after the removal of n elements.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,1,2]
Output: -1
Explanation: Here, nums has 3 elements, so n = 1. 
Thus we have to remove 1 element from nums and divide the array into two equal parts.
- If we remove nums[0] = 3, the array will be [1,2]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 1 - 2 = -1.
- If we remove nums[1] = 1, the array will be [3,2]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 2 = 1.
- If we remove nums[2] = 2, the array will be [3,1]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 1 = 2.
The minimum difference between sums of the two parts is min(-1,1,2) = -1. 

Example 2:
Input: nums = [7,9,5,8,1,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: Here n = 2. So we must remove 2 elements and divide the remaining array into two parts containing two elements each.
If we remove nums[2] = 5 and nums[3] = 8, the resultant array will be [7,9,1,3]. The difference in sums will be (7+9) - (1+3) = 12.
To obtain the minimum difference, we should remove nums[1] = 9 and nums[4] = 1. The resultant array becomes [7,5,8,3]. The difference in sums of the two parts is (7+5) - (8+3) = 1.
It can be shown that it is not possible to obtain a difference smaller than 1.

Sort the values at odd indices of nums in non-increasing order.

	
For example, if nums = [4,1,2,3] before this step, it becomes [4,3,2,1] after. The values at odd indices 1 and 3 are sorted in non-increasing order.


Sort the values at even indices of nums in non-decreasing order.
	
For example, if nums = [4,1,2,3] before this step, it becomes [2,1,4,3] after. The values at even indices 0 and 2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.



Return the array formed after rearranging the values of nums.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,1,2,3]
Output: [2,3,4,1]
Explanation: 
First, we sort the values present at odd indices (1 and 3) in non-increasing order.
So, nums changes from [4,1,2,3] to [4,3,2,1].
Next, we sort the values present at even indices (0 and 2) in non-decreasing order.
So, nums changes from [4,1,2,3] to [2,3,4,1].
Thus, the array formed after rearranging the values is [2,3,4,1].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,1]

As the train conductor, you would like to get rid of all the cars containing illegal goods. You can do any of the following three operations any number of times:

Remove a train car from the left end (i.e., remove s[0]) which takes 1 unit of time.
Remove a train car from the right end (i.e., remove s[s.length - 1]) which takes 1 unit of time.
Remove a train car from anywhere in the sequence which takes 2 units of time.

Return the minimum time to remove all the cars containing illegal goods.
Note that an empty sequence of cars is considered to have no cars containing illegal goods.
 
Example 1:

One way to remove all the cars containing illegal goods from the sequence is to
- remove a car from the left end 2 times. Time taken is 2 * 1 = 2.
- remove a car from the right end. Time taken is 1.
- remove the car containing illegal goods found in the middle. Time taken is 2.
This obtains a total time of 2 + 1 + 2 = 5. 

An alternative way is to
- remove a car from the left end 2 times. Time taken is 2 * 1 = 2.
- remove a car from the right end 3 times. Time taken is 3 * 1 = 3.
This also obtains a total time of 2 + 3 = 5.

In one operation, if num1 >= num2, you must subtract num2 from num1, otherwise subtract num1 from num2.

For example, if num1 = 5 and num2 = 4, subtract num2 from num1, thus obtaining num1 = 1 and num2 = 4. However, if num1 = 4 and num2 = 5, after one operation, num1 = 4 and num2 = 1.

Return the number of operations required to make either num1 = 0 or num2 = 0.
 
Example 1:
Input: num1 = 2, num2 = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 
- Operation 1: num1 = 2, num2 = 3. Since num1 < num2, we subtract num1 from num2 and get num1 = 2, num2 = 3 - 2 = 1.
- Operation 2: num1 = 2, num2 = 1. Since num1 > num2, we subtract num2 from num1.
- Operation 3: num1 = 1, num2 = 1. Since num1 == num2, we subtract num2 from num1.
Now num1 = 0 and num2 = 1. Since num1 == 0, we do not need to perform any further operations.
So the total number of operations required is 3.

Example 2:
Input: num1 = 10, num2 = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: 
- Operation 1: num1 = 10, num2 = 10. Since num1 == num2, we subtract num2 from num1 and get num1 = 10 - 10 = 0.
Now num1 = 0 and num2 = 10. Since num1 == 0, we are done.
So the total number of operations required is 1.

Each bus can make multiple trips successively; that is, the next trip can start immediately after completing the current trip. Also, each bus operates independently; that is, the trips of one bus do not influence the trips of any other bus.
You are also given an integer totalTrips, which denotes the number of trips all buses should make in total. Return the minimum time required for all buses to complete at least totalTrips trips.
 
Example 1:
Input: time = [1,2,3], totalTrips = 5
Output: 3
Explanation:
- At time t = 1, the number of trips completed by each bus are [1,0,0]. 
  The total number of trips completed is 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.
- At time t = 2, the number of trips completed by each bus are [2,1,0]. 
  The total number of trips completed is 2 + 1 + 0 = 3.
- At time t = 3, the number of trips completed by each bus are [3,1,1].

Notes:

Elements with the same mapped values should appear in the same relative order as in the input.
The elements of nums should only be sorted based on their mapped values and not be replaced by them.

 
Example 1:
Input: mapping = [8,9,4,0,2,1,3,5,7,6], nums = [991,338,38]
Output: [338,38,991]
Explanation: 
Map the number 991 as follows:
1. mapping[9] = 6, so all occurrences of the digit 9 will become 6.
2. mapping[1] = 9, so all occurrences of the digit 1 will become 9.
Therefore, the mapped value of 991 is 669.
338 maps to 007, or 7 after removing the leading zeros.
38 maps to 07, which is also 7 after removing leading zeros.
Since 338 and 38 share the same mapped value, they should remain in the same relative order, so 338 comes before 38.
Thus, the sorted array is [338,38,991].

The sum of the two integers appended is 2 + 3 = 5, so we return 5.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [5,6], k = 6
Output: 25
Explanation: The six unique positive integers that do not appear in nums which we append are 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8.
The resulting sum of nums is 5 + 6 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 8 = 36, which is the minimum. 
The sum of the six integers appended is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 8 = 25, so we return 25.

If isLefti == 1, then childi is the left child of parenti.
If isLefti == 0, then childi is the right child of parenti.

Construct the binary tree described by descriptions and return its root.
The test cases will be generated such that the binary tree is valid.
 
Example 1:

Input: descriptions = [[20,15,1],[20,17,0],[50,20,1],[50,80,0],[80,19,1]]
Output: [50,20,80,15,17,19]
Explanation: The root node is the node with value 50 since it has no parent.
The resulting binary tree is shown in the diagram.

Example 2:

Input: descriptions = [[1,2,1],[2,3,0],[3,4,1]]

2197,44,False,2197. Replace Non-Coprime Numbers in Array,"You are given an array of integers nums. Perform the following steps:

Find any two adjacent numbers in nums that are non-coprime.
If no such numbers are found, stop the process.
Otherwise, delete the two numbers and replace them with their LCM (Least Common Multiple).
Repeat this process as long as you keep finding two adjacent non-coprime numbers.

Return the final modified array. It can be shown that replacing adjacent non-coprime numbers in any arbitrary order will lead to the same result.
The test cases are generated such that the values in the final array are less than or equal to 108.
Two values x and y are non-coprime if GCD(x, y) > 1 where GCD(x, y) is the Greatest Common Divisor of x and y.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [6,4,3,2,7,6,2]
Output: [12,7,6]
Explanation: 
- (6, 4) are non-coprime with LCM(6, 4) = 12. Now, nums = [12,3,2,7,6,2].
- (12, 3) are non-coprime with LCM(12, 3) = 12. Now, nums = [12,2,7,6,2].
- (12, 2) are non-coprime with LCM(12, 2) = 12. Now, nums = [12,7,6,2].
- (6, 2) are non-coprime with LCM(6, 2) = 6. Now, nums = [12,7,6].
There are no more adjacent non-coprime numbers in nums.
Thus, the final modified array is [12,7,6].
Note that there are other ways to obtain the same resultant array.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,3,3,3]
Output: [2,1,1,3]
Explanation: 
- (3, 3) are non-coprime with LCM(3, 3) = 3. Now, nums = [2,2,1,1,3,3].
- (3, 3) are non-coprime with LCM(3, 3) = 3. Now, nums = [2,2,1,1,3].
- (2, 2) are non-coprime with LCM(2, 2) = 2. Now, nums = [2,1,1,3].
There are no more adjacent non-coprime numbers in nums.
Thus, the final modified array is [2,1,1,3].
Note that there are other ways to obtain the same resultant array.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105

2200,44,False,2200. Find All K-Distant Indices in an Array,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and two integers key and k. A k-distant index is an index i of nums for which there exists at least one index j such that |i - j| <= k and nums[j] == key.
Return a list of all k-distant indices sorted in increasing order.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,4,9,1,3,9,5], key = 9, k = 1
Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Explanation: Here, nums[2] == key and nums[5] == key.
- For index 0, |0 - 2| > k and |0 - 5| > k, so there is no j where |0 - j| <= k and nums[j] == key. Thus, 0 is not a k-distant index.
- For index 1, |1 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 1 is a k-distant index.
- For index 2, |2 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 2 is a k-distant index.
- For index 3, |3 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 3 is a k-distant index.
- For index 4, |4 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 4 is a k-distant index.
- For index 5, |5 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 5 is a k-distant index.
- For index 6, |6 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 6 is a k-distant index.
Thus, we return [1,2,3,4,5,6] which is sorted in increasing order. 

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2], key = 2, k = 2
Output: [0,1,2,3,4]
Explanation: For all indices i in nums, there exists some index j such that |i - j| <= k and nums[j] == key, so every index is a k-distant index. 
Hence, we return [0,1,2,3,4].

The length of the subsequence is at least 2, and
after sorting the subsequence, each element (except the first element) is the square of the previous number.

Return the length of the longest square streak in nums, or return -1 if there is no square streak.
A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,3,6,16,8,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Choose the subsequence [4,16,2]. After sorting it, it becomes [2,4,16].
- 4 = 2 * 2.
- 16 = 4 * 4.
Therefore, [4,16,2] is a square streak.
It can be shown that every subsequence of length 4 is not a square streak.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,3,5,6,7]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no square streak in nums so return -1.

You have a memory allocator with the following functionalities:

Allocate a block of size consecutive free memory units and assign it the id mID.
Free all memory units with the given id mID.

Note that:

Multiple blocks can be allocated to the same mID.
You should free all the memory units with mID, even if they were allocated in different blocks.

Implement the Allocator class:

Allocator(int n) Initializes an Allocator object with a memory array of size n.
int allocate(int size, int mID) Find the leftmost block of size consecutive free memory units and allocate it with the id mID. Return the block's first index. If such a block does not exist, return -1.
int free(int mID) Free all memory units with the id mID. Return the number of memory units you have freed.

Each power station can provide power to every city in a fixed range. In other words, if the range is denoted by r, then a power station at city i can provide power to all cities j such that |i - j| <= r and 0 <= i, j <= n - 1.

Note that |x| denotes absolute value. For example, |7 - 5| = 2 and |3 - 10| = 7.

The power of a city is the total number of power stations it is being provided power from.

Given the two integers r and k, return the maximum possible minimum power of a city, if the additional power stations are built optimally.
Note that you can build the k power stations in multiple cities.
 
Example 1:
Input: stations = [1,2,4,5,0], r = 1, k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: 
One of the optimal ways is to install both the power stations at city 1. 
So stations will become [1,4,4,5,0].
- City 0 is provided by 1 + 4 = 5 power stations.
- City 1 is provided by 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 power stations.
- City 2 is provided by 4 + 4 + 5 = 13 power stations.
- City 3 is provided by 5 + 4 = 9 power stations.
- City 4 is provided by 5 + 0 = 5 power stations.

2532,51,False,2532. Time to Cross a Bridge,"There are k workers who want to move n boxes from an old warehouse to a new one. You are given the two integers n and k, and a 2D integer array time of size k x 4 where time[i] = [leftToRighti, pickOldi, rightToLefti, putNewi].
The warehouses are separated by a river and connected by a bridge. The old warehouse is on the right bank of the river, and the new warehouse is on the left bank of the river. Initially, all k workers are waiting on the left side of the bridge. To move the boxes, the ith worker (0-indexed) can :

Cross the bridge from the left bank (new warehouse) to the right bank (old warehouse) in leftToRighti minutes.
Pick a box from the old warehouse and return to the bridge in pickOldi minutes. Different workers can pick up their boxes simultaneously.
Cross the bridge from the right bank (old warehouse) to the left bank (new warehouse) in rightToLefti minutes.
Put the box in the new warehouse and return to the bridge in putNewi minutes. Different workers can put their boxes simultaneously.

A worker i is less efficient than a worker j if either condition is met:

leftToRighti + rightToLefti > leftToRightj + rightToLeftj
leftToRighti + rightToLefti == leftToRightj + rightToLeftj and i > j

The following rules regulate the movement of the workers through the bridge :

If a worker x reaches the bridge while another worker y is crossing the bridge, x waits at their side of the bridge.
If the bridge is free, the worker waiting on the right side of the bridge gets to cross the bridge. If more than one worker is waiting on the right side, the one with the lowest efficiency crosses first.
If the bridge is free and no worker is waiting on the right side, and at least one box remains at the old warehouse, the worker on the left side of the river gets to cross the bridge. If more than one worker is waiting on the left side, the one with the lowest efficiency crosses first.

Return the instance of time at which the last worker reaches the left bank of the river after all n boxes have been put in the new warehouse.

Split the array into some number of non-empty subarrays. The cost of a split is the sum of the importance value of each subarray in the split.
Let trimmed(subarray) be the version of the subarray where all numbers which appear only once are removed.

For example, trimmed([3,1,2,4,3,4]) = [3,4,3,4].

The importance value of a subarray is k + trimmed(subarray).length.

For example, if a subarray is [1,2,3,3,3,4,4], then trimmed([1,2,3,3,3,4,4]) = [3,3,3,4,4].The importance value of this subarray will be k + 5.

No bag is empty.
If the ith marble and jth marble are in a bag, then all marbles with an index between the ith and jth indices should also be in that same bag.
If a bag consists of all the marbles with an index from i to j inclusively, then the cost of the bag is weights[i] + weights[j].

The score after distributing the marbles is the sum of the costs of all the k bags.

The concatenation value of nums is initially equal to 0. Perform this operation until nums becomes empty:

If there exists more than one number in nums, pick the first element and last element in nums respectively and add the value of their concatenation to the concatenation value of nums, then delete the first and last element from nums.
If one element exists, add its value to the concatenation value of nums, then delete it.

Return the concatenation value of the nums.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [7,52,2,4]
Output: 596
Explanation: Before performing any operation, nums is [7,52,2,4] and concatenation value is 0.
 - In the first operation:
We pick the first element, 7, and the last element, 4.
Their concatenation is 74, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 74.
Then we delete them from nums, so nums becomes equal to [52,2].
 - In the second operation:
We pick the first element, 52, and the last element, 2.
Their concatenation is 522, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 596.
Then we delete them from the nums, so nums becomes empty.
Since the concatenation value is 596 so the answer is 596.

Explanation: Before performing any operation, nums is [5,14,13,8,12] and concatenation value is 0.
 - In the first operation:
We pick the first element, 5, and the last element, 12.
Their concatenation is 512, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 512.
Then we delete them from the nums, so nums becomes equal to [14,13,8].
 - In the second operation:
We pick the first element, 14, and the last element, 8.
Their concatenation is 148, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 660.
Then we delete them from the nums, so nums becomes equal to [13].
 - In the third operation:
nums has only one element, so we pick 13 and add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 673.
Then we delete it from nums, so nums become empty.
Since the concatenation value is 673 so the answer is 673.

Return an array ans where ans[i] = [lefti, righti] is the answer to the ith query.
A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""101101"", queries = [[0,5],[1,2]]
Output: [[0,2],[2,3]]
Explanation: For the first query the substring in range [0,2] is ""101"" which has a decimal value of 5, and 5 ^ 0 = 5, hence the answer to the first query is [0,2]. In the second query, the substring in range [2,3] is ""11"", and has a decimal value of 3, and 3 ^ 1 = 2. So, [2,3] is returned for the second query. 


Example 2:
Input: s = ""0101"", queries = [[12,8]]
Output: [[-1,-1]]
Explanation: In this example there is no substring that answers the query, hence [-1,-1] is returned.

Example 3:
Input: s = ""1"", queries = [[4,5]]
Output: [[0,0]]
Explanation: For this example, the substring in range [0,0] has a decimal value of 1, and 1 ^ 4 = 5. So, the answer is [0,0].

You are allowed to remove any number of characters from the string t.
The score of the string is 0 if no characters are removed from the string t, otherwise:

Let left be the minimum index among all removed characters.
Let right be the maximum index among all removed characters.

Then the score of the string is right - left + 1.
Return the minimum possible score to make t a subsequence of s.
A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., ""ace"" is a subsequence of ""abcde"" while ""aec"" is not).
 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""abacaba"", t = ""bzaa""
Output: 1
Explanation: In this example, we remove the character ""z"" at index 1 (0-indexed).
The string t becomes ""baa"" which is a subsequence of the string ""abacaba"" and the score is 1 - 1 + 1 = 1.
It can be proven that 1 is the minimum score that we can achieve.

Return the difference between the maximum and minimum values Danny can make by remapping exactly one digit in num.
Notes:

When Danny remaps a digit d1 to another digit d2, Danny replaces all occurrences of d1 in num with d2.
Danny can remap a digit to itself, in which case num does not change.
Danny can remap different digits for obtaining minimum and maximum values respectively.
The resulting number after remapping can contain leading zeroes.
We mentioned ""Danny Mittal"" to congratulate him on being in the top 10 in Weekly Contest 326.

 
Example 1:
Input: num = 11891
Output: 99009
Explanation: 
To achieve the maximum value, Danny can remap the digit 1 to the digit 9 to yield 99899.
To achieve the minimum value, Danny can remap the digit 1 to the digit 0, yielding 890.
The difference between these two numbers is 99009.

Example 2:
Input: num = 90

The high score of nums is the maximum value of |nums[i] - nums[j]| over all 0 <= i < j < nums.length.
The score of nums is the sum of the high and low scores of nums.

To minimize the score of nums, we can change the value of at most two elements of nums.
Return the minimum possible score after changing the value of at most two elements of nums.
Note that |x| denotes the absolute value of x.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,4,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: Change value of nums[1] and nums[2] to 1 so that nums becomes [1,1,1]. Now, the value of |nums[i] - nums[j]| is always equal to 0, so we return 0 + 0 = 0.

You are to split ranges into two (possibly empty) groups such that:

Each range belongs to exactly one group.
Any two overlapping ranges must belong to the same group.

Two ranges are said to be overlapping if there exists at least one integer that is present in both ranges.

For example, [1, 3] and [2, 5] are overlapping because 2 and 3 occur in both ranges.

Return the total number of ways to split ranges into two groups. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 
Example 1:
Input: ranges = [[6,10],[5,15]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The two ranges are overlapping, so they must be in the same group.
Thus, there are two possible ways:
- Put both the ranges together in group 1.
- Put both the ranges together in group 2.

Example 2:
Input: ranges = [[1,3],[10,20],[2,5],[4,8]]

Alice wants Bob to find the root of the tree. She allows Bob to make several guesses about her tree. In one guess, he does the following:

Chooses two distinct integers u and v such that there exists an edge [u, v] in the tree.
He tells Alice that u is the parent of v in the tree.

Bob's guesses are represented by a 2D integer array guesses where guesses[j] = [uj, vj] indicates Bob guessed uj to be the parent of vj.
Alice being lazy, does not reply to each of Bob's guesses, but just says that at least k of his guesses are true.
Given the 2D integer arrays edges, guesses and the integer k, return the number of possible nodes that can be the root of Alice's tree. If there is no such tree, return 0.

Output: 15
Explanation: In this example, the first mouse eats the 2nd (0-indexed) and the 3rd types of cheese, and the second mouse eats the 0th and the 1st types of cheese.
The total points are 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 15.
It can be proven that 15 is the maximum total points that the mice can achieve.

Example 2:
Input: reward1 = [1,1], reward2 = [1,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: In this example, the first mouse eats the 0th (0-indexed) and 1st types of cheese, and the second mouse does not eat any cheese.
The total points are 1 + 1 = 2.
It can be proven that 2 is the maximum total points that the mice can achieve.

2612,53,False,2612. Minimum Reverse Operations,"You are given an integer n and an integer p in the range [0, n - 1]. Representing a 0-indexed array arr of length n where all positions are set to 0's, except position p which is set to 1.
You are also given an integer array banned containing some positions from the array. For the ith position in banned, arr[banned[i]] = 0, and banned[i] != p.
You can perform multiple operations on arr. In an operation, you can choose a subarray with size k and reverse the subarray. However, the 1 in arr should never go to any of the positions in banned. In other words, after each operation arr[banned[i]] remains 0.
Return an array ans where for each i from [0, n - 1], ans[i] is the minimum number of reverse operations needed to bring the 1 to position i in arr, or -1 if it is impossible.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
The values of ans[i] are independent for all i's.
The reverse of an array is an array containing the values in reverse order.

 
Example 1:
Input: n = 4, p = 0, banned = [1,2], k = 4
Output: [0,-1,-1,1]
Explanation: In this case k = 4 so there is only one possible reverse operation we can perform, which is reversing the whole array. Initially, 1 is placed at position 0 so the amount of operations we need for position 0 is 0. We can never place a 1 on the banned positions, so the answer for positions 1 and 2 is -1. Finally, with one reverse operation we can bring the 1 to index 3, so the answer for position 3 is 1. 

Example 2:
Input: n = 5, p = 0, banned = [2,4], k = 3
Output: [0,-1,-1,-1,-1]
Explanation: In this case the 1 is initially at position 0, so the answer for that position is 0. We can perform reverse operations of size 3. The 1 is currently located at position 0, so we need to reverse the subarray [0, 2] for it to leave that position, but reversing that subarray makes position 2 have a 1, which shouldn't happen. So, we can't move the 1 from position 0, making the result for all the other positions -1. 

Example 3:
Input: n = 4, p = 2, banned = [0,1,3], k = 1
Output: [-1,-1,0,-1]
Explanation: In this case we can only perform reverse operations of size 1. So the 1 never changes its position.

Note that:

An integer is prime if it is greater than 1 and has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself.
An integer val is on one of the diagonals of nums if there exists an integer i for which nums[i][i] = val or an i for which nums[i][nums.length - i - 1] = val.


In the above diagram, one diagonal is [1,5,9] and another diagonal is [3,5,7].
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [[1,2,3],[5,6,7],[9,10,11]]
Output: 11
Explanation: The numbers 1, 3, 6, 9, and 11 are the only numbers present on at least one of the diagonals. Since 11 is the largest prime, we return 11.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [[1,2,3],[5,17,7],[9,11,10]]

Return the array arr.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,1,1,2]
Output: [5,0,3,4,0]
Explanation: 
When i = 0, nums[0] == nums[2] and nums[0] == nums[3]. Therefore, arr[0] = |0 - 2| + |0 - 3| = 5. 
When i = 1, arr[1] = 0 because there is no other index with value 3.
When i = 2, nums[2] == nums[0] and nums[2] == nums[3]. Therefore, arr[2] = |2 - 0| + |2 - 3| = 3.

Invalid input values should output an empty array. If rowsCount * colsCount !== nums.length, the input is considered invalid.
Snail traversal order starts at the top left cell with the first value of the current array. It then moves through the entire first column from top to bottom, followed by moving to the next column on the right and traversing it from bottom to top. This pattern continues, alternating the direction of traversal with each column, until the entire current array is covered.

A multi-dimensional array is a recursive data structure that contains integers or other multi-dimensional arrays.
A flattened array is a version of that array with some or all of the sub-arrays removed and replaced with the actual elements in that sub-array. This flattening operation should only be done if the current depth of nesting is less than n. The depth of the elements in the first array are considered to be 0.
Please solve it without the built-in Array.flat method.

Explanation
Passing a depth of n=0 will always result in the original array. This is because the smallest possible depth of a subarray (0) is not less than n=0. Thus, no subarray should be flattened. 
Example 2:
Input
arr = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12], [13, 14, 15]]
n = 1
Output

Explanation
The subarrays starting with 4, 7, and 13 are all flattened. This is because their depth of 0 is less than 1. However [9, 10, 11] remains unflattened because its depth is 1.

2627,53,False,2627. Debounce,"Given a function fn and a time in milliseconds t, return a debounced version of that function.
A debounced function is a function whose execution is delayed by t milliseconds and whose execution is cancelled if it is called again within that window of time. The debounced function should also receive the passed parameters.
For example, let's say t = 50ms, and the function was called at 30ms, 60ms, and 100ms. The first 2 function calls would be cancelled, and the 3rd function call would be executed at 150ms. If instead t = 35ms, The 1st call would be cancelled, the 2nd would be executed at 95ms, and the 3rd would be executed at 135ms.

The above diagram shows how debounce will transform events. Each rectangle represents 100ms and the debounce time is 400ms. Each color represents a different set of inputs.

2630,53,False,2630. Memoize II,"Given a function fn, return a memoized version of that function.
A memoized function is a function that will never be called twice with the same inputs. Instead it will return a cached value.
fn can be any function and there are no constraints on what type of values it accepts. Inputs are considered identical if they are === to each other.
 
Example 1:
Input: 
getInputs = () => [[2,2],[2,2],[1,2]]
fn = function (a, b) { return a + b; }
Output: [{""val"":4,""calls"":1},{""val"":4,""calls"":1},{""val"":3,""calls"":2}]
Explanation:
const inputs = getInputs();
const memoized = memoize(fn);
for (const arr of inputs) {
  memoized(...arr);
}

For the inputs of (2, 2): 2 + 2 = 4, and it required a call to fn().
For the inputs of (2, 2): 2 + 2 = 4, but those inputs were seen before so no call to fn() was required.
For the inputs of (1, 2): 1 + 2 = 3, and it required another call to fn() for a total of 2.

Example 2:
Input: 
getInputs = () => [[{},{}],[{},{}],[{},{}]] 
fn = function (a, b) { return ({...a, ...b}); }
Output: [{""val"":{},""calls"":1},{""val"":{},""calls"":2},{""val"":{},""calls"":3}]
Explanation:
Merging two empty objects will always result in an empty object. It may seem like there should only be 1 call to fn() because of cache-hits, however none of those objects are === to each other.

Example 3:
Input:

Output: [{""val"":{},""calls"":1},{""val"":{},""calls"":1},{""val"":{},""calls"":1}]
Explanation:
Merging two empty objects will always result in an empty object. The 2nd and 3rd third function calls result in a cache-hit. This is because every object passed in is identical.

2631,53,False,2631. Group By,"Write code that enhances all arrays such that you can call the array.groupBy(fn) method on any array and it will return a grouped version of the array.
A grouped array is an object where each key is the output of fn(arr[i]) and each value is an array containing all items in the original array with that key.
The provided callback fn will accept an item in the array and return a string key.
The order of each value list should be the order the items appear in the array. Any order of keys is acceptable.
Please solve it without lodash's _.groupBy function.

  return item.id; 
}
Output: 
{ 
  ""1"": [{""id"": ""1""}, {""id"": ""1""}],   
  ""2"": [{""id"": ""2""}] 
}
Explanation:
Output is from array.groupBy(fn).
The selector function gets the ""id"" out of each item in the array.
There are two objects with an ""id"" of 1. Both of those objects are put in the first array.
There is one object with an ""id"" of 2. That object is put in the second array.

Explanation:
The array can be of any type. In this case, the selector function defines the key as being the first element in the array. 
All the arrays have 1 as their first element so they are grouped together.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,7,9,3,9], divisors = [5,2,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: The divisibility score for every element in divisors is:
The divisibility score of divisors[0] is 0 since no number in nums is divisible by 5.
The divisibility score of divisors[1] is 1 since nums[0] is divisible by 2.
The divisibility score of divisors[2] is 3 since nums[2], nums[3], and nums[4] are divisible by 3.

You are given the integer n and a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
Each node has an associated price. You are given an integer array price, where price[i] is the price of the ith node.

Explanation: The diagram above denotes the tree after rooting it at node 2. The first part shows the initial tree and the second part shows the tree after choosing nodes 0, 2, and 3, and making their price half.
For the 1st trip, we choose path [0,1,3]. The price sum of that path is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

2650,53,False,2650. Design Cancellable Function,"Sometimes you have a long running task, and you may wish to cancel it before it completes. To help with this goal, write a function cancellable that accepts a generator object and returns an array of two values: a cancel function and a promise.
You may assume the generator function will only yield promises. It is your function's responsibility to pass the values resolved by the promise back to the generator. If the promise rejects, your function should throw that error back to the generator.
If the cancel callback is called before the generator is done, your function should throw an error back to the generator. That error should be the string ""Cancelled"" (Not an Error object). If the error was caught, the returned promise should resolve with the next value that was yielded or returned. Otherwise, the promise should reject with the thrown error. No more code should be executed.
When the generator is done, the promise your function returned should resolve the value the generator returned. If, however, the generator throws an error, the returned promise should reject with the error.
An example of how your code would be used:
function* tasks() {
  const val = yield new Promise(resolve => resolve(2 + 2));
  yield new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
  return val + 1; // calculation shouldn't be done.
}
const [cancel, promise] = cancellable(tasks());
setTimeout(cancel, 50);
promise.catch(console.log); // logs ""Cancelled"" at t=50ms

If instead cancel() was not called or was called after t=100ms, the promise would have resolved 5.
 
Example 1:
Input: 
generatorFunction = function*() { 
  return 42; 
}
cancelledAt = 100
Output: {""resolved"": 42}
Explanation:
const generator = generatorFunction();
const [cancel, promise] = cancellable(generator);
setTimeout(cancel, 100);
promise.then(console.log); // resolves 42 at t=0ms

The generator immediately yields 42 and finishes. Because of that, the returned promise immediately resolves 42. Note that cancelling a finished generator does nothing.

Example 2:
Input:
generatorFunction = function*() { 
  const msg = yield new Promise(res => res(""Hello"")); 
  throw `Error: ${msg}`; 
}
cancelledAt = null
Output: {""rejected"": ""Error: Hello""}
Explanation:
A promise is yielded. The function handles this by waiting for it to resolve and then passes the resolved value back to the generator. Then an error is thrown which has the effect of causing the promise to reject with the same thrown error.

Example 3:
Input: 
generatorFunction = function*() { 
  yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 200)); 
  return ""Success""; 
}
cancelledAt = 100
Output: {""rejected"": ""Cancelled""}
Explanation:
While the function is waiting for the yielded promise to resolve, cancel() is called. This causes an error message to be sent back to the generator. Since this error is uncaught, the returned promise rejected with this error.

Example 4:
Input:
generatorFunction = function*() { 
  let result = 0; 
  yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100));
  result += yield new Promise(res => res(1)); 
  yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100)); 
  result += yield new Promise(res => res(1)); 
  return result;
}
cancelledAt = null
Output: {""resolved"": 2}
Explanation:
4 promises are yielded. Two of those promises have their values added to the result. After 200ms, the generator finishes with a value of 2, and that value is resolved by the returned promise.

Example 5:
Input: 
generatorFunction = function*() { 
  let result = 0; 
  try { 
    yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100)); 
    result += yield new Promise(res => res(1)); 
    yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100)); 
    result += yield new Promise(res => res(1)); 
  } catch(e) { 
    return result; 
  } 
  return result; 
}
cancelledAt = 150
Output: {""resolved"": 1}
Explanation:
The first two yielded promises resolve and cause the result to increment. However, at t=150ms, the generator is cancelled. The error sent to the generator is caught and the result is returned and finally resolved by the returned promise.

Example 6:
Input: 
generatorFunction = function*() { 
  try { 
    yield new Promise((resolve, reject) => reject(""Promise Rejected"")); 
  } catch(e) { 
    let a = yield new Promise(resolve => resolve(2));
    let b = yield new Promise(resolve => resolve(2)); 
    return a + b; 
  }; 
}
cancelledAt = null
Output: {""resolved"": 4}
Explanation:
The first yielded promise immediately rejects. This error is caught. Because the generator hasn't been cancelled, execution continues as usual. It ends up resolving 2 + 2 = 4.

cancelledAt == null or 0 <= cancelledAt <= 1000

A prefix common array of A and B is an array C such that C[i] is equal to the count of numbers that are present at or before the index i in both A and B.
Return the prefix common array of A and B.
A sequence of n integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from 1 to n exactly once.
 
Example 1:
Input: A = [1,3,2,4], B = [3,1,2,4]
Output: [0,2,3,4]
Explanation: At i = 0: no number is common, so C[0] = 0.
At i = 1: 1 and 3 are common in A and B, so C[1] = 2.
At i = 2: 1, 2, and 3 are common in A and B, so C[2] = 3.
At i = 3: 1, 2, 3, and 4 are common in A and B, so C[3] = 4.

Example 2:
Input: A = [2,3,1], B = [3,1,2]

You are also given the array target where target = [targetX, targetY] represents your target position (targetX, targetY).
The cost of going from a position (x1, y1) to any other position in the space (x2, y2) is |x2 - x1| + |y2 - y1|.
There are also some special roads. You are given a 2D array specialRoads where specialRoads[i] = [x1i, y1i, x2i, y2i, costi] indicates that the ith special road can take you from (x1i, y1i) to (x2i, y2i) with a cost equal to costi. You can use each special road any number of times.
Return the minimum cost required to go from (startX, startY) to (targetX, targetY).
 
Example 1:
Input: start = [1,1], target = [4,5], specialRoads = [[1,2,3,3,2],[3,4,4,5,1]]
Output: 5
Explanation: The optimal path from (1,1) to (4,5) is the following:
- (1,1) -> (1,2). This move has a cost of |1 - 1| + |2 - 1| = 1.
- (1,2) -> (3,3). This move uses the first special edge, the cost is 2.
- (3,3) -> (3,4). This move has a cost of |3 - 3| + |4 - 3| = 1.
- (3,4) -> (4,5). This move uses the second special edge, the cost is 1.
So the total cost is 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 5.
It can be shown that we cannot achieve a smaller total cost than 5.

Example 2:
Input: start = [3,2], target = [5,7], specialRoads = [[3,2,3,4,4],[3,3,5,5,5],[3,4,5,6,6]]

A chunked array contains the original elements in arr, but consists of subarrays each of length size. The length of the last subarray may be less than size if arr.length is not evenly divisible by size.
You may assume the array is the output of JSON.parse. In other words, it is valid JSON.
Please solve it without using lodash's _.chunk function.
 
Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], size = 1
Output: [[1],[2],[3],[4],[5]]
Explanation: The arr has been split into subarrays each with 1 element.

Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,9,6,3,2], size = 3
Output: [[1,9,6],[3,2]]
Explanation: The arr has been split into subarrays with 3 elements. However, only two elements are left for the 2nd subarray.

Example 3:
Input: arr = [8,5,3,2,6], size = 6
Output: [[8,5,3,2,6]]
Explanation: Size is greater than arr.length thus all elements are in the first subarray.

Example 4:
Input: arr = [], size = 1
Output: []
Explanation: There are no elements to be chunked so an empty array is returned.

More formally, moving clockwise from the ith friend brings you to the (i+1)th friend for 1 <= i < n, and moving clockwise from the nth friend brings you to the 1st friend.
The rules of the game are as follows:
1st friend receives the ball.

After that, 1st friend passes it to the friend who is k steps away from them in the clockwise direction.
After that, the friend who receives the ball should pass it to the friend who is 2 * k steps away from them in the clockwise direction.
After that, the friend who receives the ball should pass it to the friend who is 3 * k steps away from them in the clockwise direction, and so on and so forth.

In other words, on the ith turn, the friend holding the ball should pass it to the friend who is i * k steps away from them in the clockwise direction.
The game is finished when some friend receives the ball for the second time.
The losers of the game are friends who did not receive the ball in the entire game.

  const totalCost = price * (1 + taxRate);
  console.log(`The cost of ${this.item} is ${totalCost}`);
}

Calling this function like tax(10, 0.1) will log ""The cost of undefined is 11"". This is because the this context was not defined.
However, calling the function like tax.callPolyfill({item: ""salad""}, 10, 0.1) will log ""The cost of salad is 11"". The this context was appropriately set, and the function logged an appropriate output.

subscribe - This method takes in two arguments: the name of an event as a string and a callback function. This callback function will later be called when the event is emitted.
	An event should be able to have multiple listeners for the same event. When emitting an event with multiple callbacks, each should be called in the order in which they were subscribed. An array of results should be returned. You can assume no callbacks passed to subscribe are referentially identical.
	The subscribe method should also return an object with an unsubscribe method that enables the user to unsubscribe. When it is called, the callback should be removed from the list of subscriptions and undefined should be returned.
emit - This method takes in two arguments: the name of an event as a string and an optional array of arguments that will be passed to the callback(s).

- Remove the substring ""FCACDB"", so s = ""FCAB"".
- Remove the substring ""FCAB"", so s = ""FC"".
So the resulting length of the string is 2.
It can be shown that it is the minimum length that we can obtain.
Example 2:
Input: s = ""ACBBD""
Output: 5
Explanation: We cannot do any operations on the string so the length remains the same.

2698,54,False,2698. Find the Punishment Number of an Integer,"Given a positive integer n, return the punishment number of n.
The punishment number of n is defined as the sum of the squares of all integers i such that:

1 <= i <= n
The decimal representation of i * i can be partitioned into contiguous substrings such that the sum of the integer values of these substrings equals i.

 
Example 1:
Input: n = 10
Output: 182
Explanation: There are exactly 3 integers i that satisfy the conditions in the statement:
- 1 since 1 * 1 = 1
- 9 since 9 * 9 = 81 and 81 can be partitioned into 8 + 1.
- 10 since 10 * 10 = 100 and 100 can be partitioned into 10 + 0.
Hence, the punishment number of 10 is 1 + 81 + 100 = 182

Some edges have a weight of -1 (wi = -1), while others have a positive weight (wi > 0).
Your task is to modify all edges with a weight of -1 by assigning them positive integer values in the range [1, 2 * 109] so that the shortest distance between the nodes source and destination becomes equal to an integer target. If there are multiple modifications that make the shortest distance between source and destination equal to target, any of them will be considered correct.

Return true if it is possible to traverse between all such pairs of indices, or false otherwise.
 
Example 1:

Explanation: In this example, there are 3 possible pairs of indices: (0, 1), (0, 2), and (1, 2).
To go from index 0 to index 1, we can use the sequence of traversals 0 -> 2 -> 1, where we move from index 0 to index 2 because gcd(nums[0], nums[2]) = gcd(2, 6) = 2 > 1, and then move from index 2 to index 1 because gcd(nums[2], nums[1]) = gcd(6, 3) = 3 > 1.
To go from index 0 to index 2, we can just go directly because gcd(nums[0], nums[2]) = gcd(2, 6) = 2 > 1. Likewise, to go from index 1 to index 2, we can just go directly because gcd(nums[1], nums[2]) = gcd(3, 6) = 3 > 1.

2716,55,False,2716. Minimize String Length,"Given a 0-indexed string s, repeatedly perform the following operation any number of times:

Choose an index i in the string, and let c be the character in position i. Delete the closest occurrence of c to the left of i (if any) and the closest occurrence of c to the right of i (if any).

Your task is to minimize the length of s by performing the above operation any number of times.
Return an integer denoting the length of the minimized string.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""aaabc""
Output: 3
Explanation: In this example, s is ""aaabc"". We can start by selecting the character 'a' at index 1. We then remove the closest 'a' to the left of index 1, which is at index 0, and the closest 'a' to the right of index 1, which is at index 2. After this operation, the string becomes ""abc"". Any further operation we perform on the string will leave it unchanged. Therefore, the length of the minimized string is 3.
Example 2:
Input: s = ""cbbd""
Output: 3
Explanation: For this we can start with character 'b' at index 1. There is no occurrence of 'b' to the left of index 1, but there is one to the right at index 2, so we delete the 'b' at index 2. The string becomes ""cbd"" and further operations will leave it unchanged. Hence, the minimized length is 3. 

Example 3:
Input: s = ""dddaaa""
Output: 2
Explanation: For this, we can start with the character 'd' at index 1. The closest occurrence of a 'd' to its left is at index 0, and the closest occurrence of a 'd' to its right is at index 2. We delete both index 0 and 2, so the string becomes ""daaa"". In the new string, we can select the character 'a' at index 2. The closest occurrence of an 'a' to its left is at index 1, and the closest occurrence of an 'a' to its right is at index 3. We delete both of them, and the string becomes ""da"". We cannot minimize this further, so the minimized length is 2.

The length of joinedArray should be the length of unique values of id. The returned array should be sorted in ascending order based on the id key.
If a given id exists in one array but not the other, the single object with that id should be included in the result array without modification.
If two objects share an id, their properties should be merged into a single object:

If a key only exists in one object, that single key-value pair should be included in the object.
If a key is included in both objects, the value in the object from arr2 should override the value from arr1.

2731,55,False,2731. Movement of Robots,"Some robots are standing on an infinite number line with their initial coordinates given by a 0-indexed integer array nums and will start moving once given the command to move. The robots will move a unit distance each second.
You are given a string s denoting the direction in which robots will move on command. 'L' means the robot will move towards the left side or negative side of the number line, whereas 'R' means the robot will move towards the right side or positive side of the number line.
If two robots collide, they will start moving in opposite directions.
Return the sum of distances between all the pairs of robots d seconds after the command. Since the sum can be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
Note: 

For two robots at the index i and j, pair (i,j) and pair (j,i) are considered the same pair.
When robots collide, they instantly change their directions without wasting any time.
Collision happens when two robots share the same place in a moment.
	
For example, if a robot is positioned in 0 going to the right and another is positioned in 2 going to the left, the next second they'll be both in 1 and they will change direction and the next second the first one will be in 0, heading left, and another will be in 2, heading right.
For example, if a robot is positioned in 0 going to the right and another is positioned in 1 going to the left, the next second the first one will be in 0, heading left, and another will be in 1, heading right.



 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [-2,0,2], s = ""RLL"", d = 3
Output: 8
Explanation: 
After 1 second, the positions are [-1,-1,1]. Now, the robot at index 0 will move left, and the robot at index 1 will move right.
After 2 seconds, the positions are [-2,0,0]. Now, the robot at index 1 will move left, and the robot at index 2 will move right.
After 3 seconds, the positions are [-3,-1,1].
The distance between the robot at index 0 and 1 is abs(-3 - (-1)) = 2.
The distance between the robot at index 0 and 2 is abs(-3 - 1) = 4.
The distance between the robot at index 1 and 2 is abs(-1 - 1) = 2.
The sum of the pairs of all distances = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,0], s = ""RL"", d = 2

Explanation: 
After 1 second, the positions are [2,-1].
After 2 seconds, the positions are [3,-2].

Let us call a non-empty subset of rows good if the sum of each column of the subset is at most half of the length of the subset.
More formally, if the length of the chosen subset of rows is k, then the sum of each column should be at most floor(k / 2).
Return an integer array that contains row indices of a good subset sorted in ascending order.
If there are multiple good subsets, you can return any of them. If there are no good subsets, return an empty array.
A subset of rows of the matrix grid is any matrix that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none or all) rows from grid.
 
Example 1:
Input: grid = [[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: We can choose the 0th and 1st rows to create a good subset of rows.
The length of the chosen subset is 2.
- The sum of the 0th column is 0 + 0 = 0, which is at most half of the length of the subset.

The cost of collecting the chocolate at the index i is nums[i]. Each chocolate is of a different type, and initially, the chocolate at the index i is of ith type.
In one operation, you can do the following with an incurred cost of x:

Simultaneously change the chocolate of ith type to ((i + 1) mod n)th type for all chocolates.

Return the minimum cost to collect chocolates of all types, given that you can perform as many operations as you would like.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [20,1,15], x = 5
Output: 13
Explanation: Initially, the chocolate types are [0,1,2]. We will buy the 1st type of chocolate at a cost of 1.
Now, we will perform the operation at a cost of 5, and the types of chocolates will become [1,2,0]. We will buy the 2nd type of chocolate at a cost of 1.
Now, we will again perform the operation at a cost of 5, and the chocolate types will become [2,0,1]. We will buy the 0th type of chocolate at a cost of 1. 
Thus, the total cost will become (1 + 5 + 1 + 5 + 1) = 13. We can prove that this is optimal.

Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [4,3,1,2], nums2 = [2,4,9,5], queries = [[4,1],[1,3],[2,5]]
Output: [6,10,7]
Explanation: 
For the 1st query xi = 4 and yi = 1, we can select index j = 0 since nums1[j] >= 4 and nums2[j] >= 1. The sum nums1[j] + nums2[j] is 6, and we can show that 6 is the maximum we can obtain.

For the 2nd query xi = 1 and yi = 3, we can select index j = 2 since nums1[j] >= 1 and nums2[j] >= 3. The sum nums1[j] + nums2[j] is 10, and we can show that 10 is the maximum we can obtain. 

For the 3rd query xi = 2 and yi = 5, we can select index j = 3 since nums1[j] >= 2 and nums2[j] >= 5. The sum nums1[j] + nums2[j] is 7, and we can show that 7 is the maximum we can obtain.

Return the total number of beautiful pairs in nums.
Two integers x and y are coprime if there is no integer greater than 1 that divides both of them. In other words, x and y are coprime if gcd(x, y) == 1, where gcd(x, y) is the greatest common divisor of x and y.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,5,1,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: There are 5 beautiful pairs in nums:
When i = 0 and j = 1: the first digit of nums[0] is 2, and the last digit of nums[1] is 5. We can confirm that 2 and 5 are coprime, since gcd(2,5) == 1.
When i = 0 and j = 2: the first digit of nums[0] is 2, and the last digit of nums[2] is 1. Indeed, gcd(2,1) == 1.
When i = 1 and j = 2: the first digit of nums[1] is 5, and the last digit of nums[2] is 1. Indeed, gcd(5,1) == 1.
When i = 1 and j = 3: the first digit of nums[1] is 5, and the last digit of nums[3] is 4. Indeed, gcd(5,4) == 1.
When i = 2 and j = 3: the first digit of nums[2] is 1, and the last digit of nums[3] is 4. Indeed, gcd(1,4) == 1.
Thus, we return 5.

2751,56,False,2751. Robot Collisions,"There are n 1-indexed robots, each having a position on a line, health, and movement direction.
You are given 0-indexed integer arrays positions, healths, and a string directions (directions[i] is either 'L' for left or 'R' for right). All integers in positions are unique.
All robots start moving on the line simultaneously at the same speed in their given directions. If two robots ever share the same position while moving, they will collide.
If two robots collide, the robot with lower health is removed from the line, and the health of the other robot decreases by one. The surviving robot continues in the same direction it was going. If both robots have the same health, they are both removed from the line.
Your task is to determine the health of the robots that survive the collisions, in the same order that the robots were given, i.e. final heath of robot 1 (if survived), final health of robot 2 (if survived), and so on. If there are no survivors, return an empty array.
Return an array containing the health of the remaining robots (in the order they were given in the input), after no further collisions can occur.
Note: The positions may be unsorted.
 
 
Example 1:

Input: positions = [5,4,3,2,1], healths = [2,17,9,15,10], directions = ""RRRRR""
Output: [2,17,9,15,10]
Explanation: No collision occurs in this example, since all robots are moving in the same direction. So, the health of the robots in order from the first robot is returned, [2, 17, 9, 15, 10].

Example 2:

Input: positions = [3,5,2,6], healths = [10,10,15,12], directions = ""RLRL""
Output: [14]
Explanation: There are 2 collisions in this example. Firstly, robot 1 and robot 2 will collide, and since both have the same health, they will be removed from the line. Next, robot 3 and robot 4 will collide and since robot 4's health is smaller, it gets removed, and robot 3's health becomes 15 - 1 = 14. Only robot 3 remains, so we return [14].

Example 3:

Input: positions = [1,2,5,6], healths = [10,10,11,11], directions = ""RLRL""
Output: []
Explanation: Robot 1 and robot 2 will collide and since both have the same health, they are both removed. Robot 3 and 4 will collide and since both have the same health, they are both removed. So, we return an empty array, [].

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n with one dominant element.
You can split nums at an index i into two arrays nums[0, ..., i] and nums[i + 1, ..., n - 1], but the split is only valid if:

Return true if the given array is good, otherwise return false.
Note: A permutation of integers represents an arrangement of these numbers.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2, 1, 3]
Output: false
Explanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 3, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 3. However, base[3] has four elements but array nums has three. Therefore, it can not be a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3]. So the answer is false.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1, 3, 3, 2]
Output: true
Explanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 3, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 3. It can be seen that nums is a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3] (by swapping the second and fourth elements in nums, we reach base[3]). Therefore, the answer is true.
Example 3:
Input: nums = [1, 1]
Output: true
Explanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 1, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 1. It can be seen that nums is a permutation of base[1] = [1, 1]. Therefore, the answer is true.
Example 4:
Input: nums = [3, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1]

Explanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 4, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 4. However, base[4] has five elements but array nums has six. Therefore, it can not be a permutation of base[4] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4]. So the answer is false.

You are also given an integer x.
Return the minimum time in which you can make the sum of all elements of nums1 to be less than or equal to x, or -1 if this is not possible.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [1,2,3], x = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: 
For the 1st second, we apply the operation on i = 0. Therefore nums1 = [0,2+2,3+3] = [0,4,6]. 
For the 2nd second, we apply the operation on i = 1. Therefore nums1 = [0+1,0,6+3] = [1,0,9].

2813,57,False,2813. Maximum Elegance of a K-Length Subsequence,"You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array items of length n and an integer k.
items[i] = [profiti, categoryi], where profiti and categoryi denote the profit and category of the ith item respectively.
Let's define the elegance of a subsequence of items as total_profit + distinct_categories2, where total_profit is the sum of all profits in the subsequence, and distinct_categories is the number of distinct categories from all the categories in the selected subsequence.
Your task is to find the maximum elegance from all subsequences of size k in items.
Return an integer denoting the maximum elegance of a subsequence of items with size exactly k.
Note: A subsequence of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the remaining elements' relative order.
 
Example 1:
Input: items = [[3,2],[5,1],[10,1]], k = 2
Output: 17
Explanation: In this example, we have to select a subsequence of size 2.
We can select items[0] = [3,2] and items[2] = [10,1].
The total profit in this subsequence is 3 + 10 = 13, and the subsequence contains 2 distinct categories [2,1].
Hence, the elegance is 13 + 22 = 17, and we can show that it is the maximum achievable elegance. 

Example 2:
Input: items = [[3,1],[3,1],[2,2],[5,3]], k = 3
Output: 19
Explanation: In this example, we have to select a subsequence of size 3. 
We can select items[0] = [3,1], items[2] = [2,2], and items[3] = [5,3]. 
The total profit in this subsequence is 3 + 2 + 5 = 10, and the subsequence contains 3 distinct categories [1,2,3]. 
Hence, the elegance is 10 + 32 = 19, and we can show that it is the maximum achievable elegance.
Example 3:
Input: items = [[1,1],[2,1],[3,1]], k = 3
Output: 7
Explanation: In this example, we have to select a subsequence of size 3. 
We should select all the items. 
The total profit will be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, and the subsequence contains 1 distinct category [1]. 
Hence, the maximum elegance is 6 + 12 = 7.

2818,57,False,2818. Apply Operations to Maximize Score,"You are given an array nums of n positive integers and an integer k.
Initially, you start with a score of 1. You have to maximize your score by applying the following operation at most k times:

Choose any non-empty subarray nums[l, ..., r] that you haven't chosen previously.
Choose an element x of nums[l, ..., r] with the highest prime score. If multiple such elements exist, choose the one with the smallest index.
Multiply your score by x.

Here, nums[l, ..., r] denotes the subarray of nums starting at index l and ending at the index r, both ends being inclusive.
The prime score of an integer x is equal to the number of distinct prime factors of x. For example, the prime score of 300 is 3 since 300 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 5 * 5.
Return the maximum possible score after applying at most k operations.
Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [8,3,9,3,8], k = 2
Output: 81
Explanation: To get a score of 81, we can apply the following operations:
- Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 2]. nums[2] is the only element in this subarray. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[2]. The score becomes 1 * 9 = 9.
- Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 3]. Both nums[2] and nums[3] have a prime score of 1, but nums[2] has the smaller index. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[2]. The score becomes 9 * 9 = 81.
It can be proven that 81 is the highest score one can obtain.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [19,12,14,6,10,18], k = 3
Output: 4788
Explanation: To get a score of 4788, we can apply the following operations: 
- Choose subarray nums[0, ..., 0]. nums[0] is the only element in this subarray. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[0]. The score becomes 1 * 19 = 19.
- Choose subarray nums[5, ..., 5]. nums[5] is the only element in this subarray. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[5]. The score becomes 19 * 18 = 342.
- Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 3]. Both nums[2] and nums[3] have a prime score of 2, but nums[2] has the smaller index. Hence, we multipy the score by nums[2]. The score becomes 342 * 14 = 4788.
It can be proven that 4788 is the highest score one can obtain.

The numbers from 0 to n - 1 are divided into three groups numbered from 1 to 3, where number i belongs to group nums[i]. Notice that some groups may be empty.

You are allowed to perform this operation any number of times:

Pick number x and change its group. More formally, change nums[x] to any number from 1 to 3.

A new array res is constructed using the following procedure:

Sort the numbers in each group independently.
Append the elements of groups 1, 2, and 3 to res in this order.

Array nums is called a beautiful array if the constructed array res is sorted in non-decreasing order.
Return the minimum number of operations to make nums a beautiful array.

Explanation: It's optimal to perform three operations:
1. change nums[0] to 1.
2. change nums[2] to 1.
3. change nums[3] to 1.
After performing the operations and sorting the numbers in each group, group 1 becomes equal to [0,1,2,3,4] and group 2 and group 3 become empty. Hence, res is equal to [0,1,2,3,4] which is sorted in non-decreasing order.
It can be proven that there is no valid sequence of less than three operations.

Explanation: It's optimal to perform two operations:
1. change nums[1] to 1.
2. change nums[2] to 1.
After performing the operations and sorting the numbers in each group, group 1 becomes equal to [0,1,2,3], group 2 becomes empty, and group 3 becomes equal to [4,5]. Hence, res is equal to [0,1,2,3,4,5] which is sorted in non-decreasing order.
It can be proven that there is no valid sequence of less than two operations.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,3,3]

You must choose one of the n players as the starting player for the game, and the ball will be passed exactly k times starting from the chosen player.
For a chosen starting player having id x, we define a function f(x) that denotes the sum of x and the ids of all players who receive the ball during the k passes, including repetitions. In other words, f(x) = x + receiver[x] + receiver[receiver[x]] + ... + receiver(k)[x].

A k-subsequence is a subsequence of s, having length k, and all its characters are unique, i.e., every character occurs once.
Let f(c) denote the number of times the character c occurs in s.
The beauty of a k-subsequence is the sum of f(c) for every character c in the k-subsequence.
For example, consider s = ""abbbdd"" and k = 2:

f('a') = 1, f('b') = 3, f('d') = 2
Some k-subsequences of s are:
	
""abbbdd"" -> ""ab"" having a beauty of f('a') + f('b') = 4
""abbbdd"" -> ""ad"" having a beauty of f('a') + f('d') = 3
""abbbdd"" -> ""bd"" having a beauty of f('b') + f('d') = 5



Return an integer denoting the number of k-subsequences whose beauty is the maximum among all k-subsequences. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
A subsequence of a string is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (possibly none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.
Notes

f(c) is the number of times a character c occurs in s, not a k-subsequence.
Two k-subsequences are considered different if one is formed by an index that is not present in the other. So, two k-subsequences may form the same string.

 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""bcca"", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: From s we have f('a') = 1, f('b') = 1, and f('c') = 2.
The k-subsequences of s are: 
bcca having a beauty of f('b') + f('c') = 3 
bcca having a beauty of f('b') + f('c') = 3 
bcca having a beauty of f('b') + f('a') = 2 
bcca having a beauty of f('c') + f('a') = 3
bcca having a beauty of f('c') + f('a') = 3 
There are 4 k-subsequences that have the maximum beauty, 3. 
Hence, the answer is 4.

You can perform the following operation any number of times:

Choose two indices, i and j, where i < j, such that nums[i] < nums[j].
Then, remove the elements at indices i and j from nums. The remaining elements retain their original order, and the array is re-indexed.

Return an integer that denotes the minimum length of nums after performing the operation any number of times (including zero).
Note that nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,4,9]
Output: 0
Explanation: Initially, nums = [1, 3, 4, 9].
In the first operation, we can choose index 0 and 1 because nums[0] < nums[1] <=> 1 < 3.
Remove indices 0 and 1, and nums becomes [4, 9].

For the ith machine to create an alloy, it needs composition[i][j] units of metal of type j. Initially, you have stock[i] units of metal type i, and purchasing one unit of metal type i costs cost[i] coins.
Given integers n, k, budget, a 1-indexed 2D array composition, and 1-indexed arrays stock and cost, your goal is to maximize the number of alloys the company can create while staying within the budget of budget coins.

We define the score of subarray nums[l..r] such that l <= r as nums[l] AND nums[l + 1] AND ... AND nums[r] where AND is the bitwise AND operation.
Consider splitting the array into one or more subarrays such that the following conditions are satisfied:

Each element of the array belongs to exactly one subarray.
The sum of scores of the subarrays is the minimum possible.

Return the maximum number of subarrays in a split that satisfies the conditions above.
A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

Define two integers, num1 and num2, as follows:

num1: The sum of all integers in the range [1, n] that are not divisible by m.
num2: The sum of all integers in the range [1, n] that are divisible by m.

Return the integer num1 - num2.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 10, m = 3
Output: 19
Explanation: In the given example:
- Integers in the range [1, 10] that are not divisible by 3 are [1,2,4,5,7,8,10], num1 is the sum of those integers = 37.
- Integers in the range [1, 10] that are divisible by 3 are [3,6,9], num2 is the sum of those integers = 18.
We return 37 - 18 = 19 as the answer.

2895,58,False,2895. Minimum Processing Time,"You have n processors each having 4 cores and n * 4 tasks that need to be executed such that each core should perform only one task.
Given a 0-indexed integer array processorTime representing the time at which each processor becomes available for the first time and a 0-indexed integer array tasks representing the time it takes to execute each task, return the minimum time when all of the tasks have been executed by the processors.
Note: Each core executes the task independently of the others.
 
Example 1:
Input: processorTime = [8,10], tasks = [2,2,3,1,8,7,4,5]

Explanation: 
It's optimal to assign the tasks at indexes 4, 5, 6, 7 to the first processor which becomes available at time = 8, and the tasks at indexes 0, 1, 2, 3 to the second processor which becomes available at time = 10. 
Time taken by the first processor to finish execution of all tasks = max(8 + 8, 8 + 7, 8 + 4, 8 + 5) = 16.
Time taken by the second processor to finish execution of all tasks = max(10 + 2, 10 + 2, 10 + 3, 10 + 1) = 13.

Time taken by the first processor to finish execution of all tasks = max(10 + 3, 10 + 5, 10 + 8, 10 + 4) = 18.
Time taken by the second processor to finish execution of all tasks = max(20 + 2, 20 + 1, 20 + 2, 20 + 3) = 23.

Start iterating from the beginning of the array; for every ""prev"" string seen in words, find the last visited integer in words which is defined as follows:

Let k be the number of consecutive ""prev"" strings seen so far (containing the current string). Let nums be the 0-indexed array of integers seen so far and nums_reverse be the reverse of nums, then the integer at (k - 1)th index of nums_reverse will be the last visited integer for this ""prev"".
If k is greater than the total visited integers, then the last visited integer will be -1.

Return an integer array containing the last visited integers.
 
Example 1:

Explanation: 
For ""prev"" at index = 2, last visited integer will be 2 as here the number of consecutive ""prev"" strings is 1, and in the array reverse_nums, 2 will be the first element.
For ""prev"" at index = 3, last visited integer will be 1 as there are a total of two consecutive ""prev"" strings including this ""prev"" which are visited, and 1 is the second last visited integer.

2910,59,False,2910. Minimum Number of Groups to Create a Valid Assignment,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n.
We want to group the indices so for each index i in the range [0, n - 1], it is assigned to exactly one group.
A group assignment is valid if the following conditions hold:

For every group g, all indices i assigned to group g have the same value in nums.
For any two groups g1 and g2, the difference between the number of indices assigned to g1 and g2 should not exceed 1.

Return an integer denoting the minimum number of groups needed to create a valid group assignment.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,3,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: One way the indices can be assigned to 2 groups is as follows, where the values in square brackets are indices:
group 1 -> [0,2,4]
group 2 -> [1,3]
All indices are assigned to one group.
In group 1, nums[0] == nums[2] == nums[4], so all indices have the same value.
In group 2, nums[1] == nums[3], so all indices have the same value.
The number of indices assigned to group 1 is 3, and the number of indices assigned to group 2 is 2.
Their difference doesn't exceed 1.
It is not possible to use fewer than 2 groups because, in order to use just 1 group, all indices assigned to that group must have the same value.
Hence, the answer is 2.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [10,10,10,3,1,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: One way the indices can be assigned to 4 groups is as follows, where the values in square brackets are indices:
group 1 -> [0]
group 2 -> [1,2]
group 3 -> [3]
group 4 -> [4,5]
The group assignment above satisfies both conditions.
It can be shown that it is not possible to create a valid assignment using fewer than 4 groups.

Return an integer denoting the minimum number of letter changes required.
Notes

A string is a palindrome if it can be read the same way from left to right and right to left.
A string with a length of len is considered a semi-palindrome if there exists a positive integer d such that 1 <= d < len and len % d == 0, and if we take indices that have the same modulo by d, they form a palindrome. For example, ""aa"", ""aba"", ""adbgad"", and, ""abab"" are semi-palindrome and ""a"", ""ab"", and, ""abca"" are not.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""abcac"", k = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: We can divide s into substrings ""ab"" and ""cac"". The string ""cac"" is already a semi-palindrome. If we change ""ab"" to ""aa"", it becomes a semi-palindrome with d = 1.
It can be shown that there is no way to divide the string ""abcac"" into two semi-palindrome substrings. Therefore, the answer would be at least 1.
Example 2:
Input: s = ""abcdef"", k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: We can divide it into substrings ""abc"" and ""def"". Each of the substrings ""abc"" and ""def"" requires one change to become a semi-palindrome, so we need 2 changes in total to make all substrings semi-palindrome.
It can be shown that we cannot divide the given string into two substrings in a way that it would require less than 2 changes.
Example 3:
Input: s = ""aabbaa"", k = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: We can divide it into substrings ""aa"", ""bb"" and ""aa"".
The strings ""aa"" and ""bb"" are already semi-palindromes. Thus, the answer is zero.

You are also given a 0-indexed array coins of size n where coins[i] indicates the number of coins in the vertex i, and an integer k.
Starting from the root, you have to collect all the coins such that the coins at a node can only be collected if the coins of its ancestors have been already collected.
Coins at nodei can be collected in one of the following ways:

Collect all the coins, but you will get coins[i] - k points. If coins[i] - k is negative then you will lose abs(coins[i] - k) points.

A directed edge from a to b in the graph means that team a is stronger than team b and team b is weaker than team a.
Team a will be the champion of the tournament if there is no team b that is stronger than team a.
Return the team that will be the champion of the tournament if there is a unique champion, otherwise, return -1.
Notes

A cycle is a series of nodes a1, a2, ..., an, an+1 such that node a1 is the same node as node an+1, the nodes a1, a2, ..., an are distinct, and there is a directed edge from the node ai to node ai+1 for every i in the range [1, n].
A DAG is a directed graph that does not have any cycle.

 
Example 1:

Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Team 1 is weaker than team 0. Team 2 is weaker than team 1. So the champion is team 0.

Example 2:

Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,2],[1,3],[1,2]]
Output: -1
Explanation: Team 2 is weaker than team 0 and team 1. Team 3 is weaker than team 1. But team 1 and team 0 are not weaker than any other teams. So the answer is -1.

 
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 100

2925,59,False,2925. Maximum Score After Applying Operations on a Tree,"There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, and rooted at node 0. You are given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
You are also given a 0-indexed integer array values of length n, where values[i] is the value associated with the ith node.
You start with a score of 0. In one operation, you can:

Pick any node i.
Add values[i] to your score.
Set values[i] to 0.

A tree is healthy if the sum of values on the path from the root to any leaf node is different than zero.
Return the maximum score you can obtain after performing these operations on the tree any number of times so that it remains healthy.
 
Example 1:

Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[2,4],[4,5]], values = [5,2,5,2,1,1]
Output: 11
Explanation: We can choose nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The value of the root is non-zero. Hence, the sum of values on the path from the root to any leaf is different than zero. Therefore, the tree is healthy and the score is values[1] + values[2] + values[3] + values[4] + values[5] = 11.
It can be shown that 11 is the maximum score obtainable after any number of operations on the tree.

Example 2:

Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6]], values = [20,10,9,7,4,3,5]
Output: 40
Explanation: We can choose nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4.
- The sum of values on the path from 0 to 4 is equal to 10.
- The sum of values on the path from 0 to 3 is equal to 10.
- The sum of values on the path from 0 to 5 is equal to 3.
- The sum of values on the path from 0 to 6 is equal to 5.
Therefore, the tree is healthy and the score is values[0] + values[2] + values[3] + values[4] = 40.
It can be shown that 40 is the maximum score obtainable after any number of operations on the tree.

There are n children standing in a queue with positions 0 to n - 1 assigned to them. The array sick contains the positions of the children who are infected with an infectious disease. An infected child at position i can spread the disease to either of its immediate neighboring children at positions i - 1 and i + 1 if they exist and are currently not infected. At most one child who was previously not infected can get infected with the disease in one second.
It can be shown that after a finite number of seconds, all the children in the queue will get infected with the disease. An infection sequence is the sequential order of positions in which all of the non-infected children get infected with the disease. Return the total number of possible infection sequences.
Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
Note that an infection sequence does not contain positions of children who were already infected with the disease in the beginning.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 5, sick = [0,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: Children at positions 1, 2, and 3 are not infected in the beginning. There are 4 possible infection sequences:
- The children at positions 1 and 3 can get infected since their positions are adjacent to the infected children 0 and 4. The child at position 1 gets infected first.
Now, the child at position 2 is adjacent to the child at position 1 who is infected and the child at position 3 is adjacent to the child at position 4 who is infected, hence either of them can get infected. The child at position 2 gets infected.
Finally, the child at position 3 gets infected because it is adjacent to children at positions 2 and 4 who are infected. The infection sequence is [1,2,3].
- The children at positions 1 and 3 can get infected because their positions are adjacent to the infected children 0 and 4. The child at position 1 gets infected first.
Now, the child at position 2 is adjacent to the child at position 1 who is infected and the child at position 3 is adjacent to the child at position 4 who is infected, hence either of them can get infected. The child at position 3 gets infected.
Finally, the child at position 2 gets infected because it is adjacent to children at positions 1 and 3 who are infected. The infection sequence is [1,3,2].
- The infection sequence is [3,1,2]. The order of infection of disease in the children can be seen as: [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4].
- The infection sequence is [3,2,1]. The order of infection of disease in the children can be seen as: [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4].

2967,60,False,2967. Minimum Cost to Make Array Equalindromic,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums having length n.
You are allowed to perform a special move any number of times (including zero) on nums. In one special move you perform the following steps in order:

Choose an index i in the range [0, n - 1], and a positive integer x.
Add |nums[i] - x| to the total cost.
Change the value of nums[i] to x.

A palindromic number is a positive integer that remains the same when its digits are reversed. For example, 121, 2552 and 65756 are palindromic numbers whereas 24, 46, 235 are not palindromic numbers.
An array is considered equalindromic if all the elements in the array are equal to an integer y, where y is a palindromic number less than 109.
Return an integer denoting the minimum possible total cost to make nums equalindromic by performing any number of special moves.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 6
Explanation: We can make the array equalindromic by changing all elements to 3 which is a palindromic number. The cost of changing the array to [3,3,3,3,3] using 4 special moves is given by |1 - 3| + |2 - 3| + |4 - 3| + |5 - 3| = 6.
It can be shown that changing all elements to any palindromic number other than 3 cannot be achieved at a lower cost.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [10,12,13,14,15]
Output: 11
Explanation: We can make the array equalindromic by changing all elements to 11 which is a palindromic number. The cost of changing the array to [11,11,11,11,11] using 5 special moves is given by |10 - 11| + |12 - 11| + |13 - 11| + |14 - 11| + |15 - 11| = 11.
It can be shown that changing all elements to any palindromic number other than 11 cannot be achieved at a lower cost.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [22,33,22,33,22]
Output: 22
Explanation: We can make the array equalindromic by changing all elements to 22 which is a palindromic number. The cost of changing the array to [22,22,22,22,22] using 2 special moves is given by |33 - 22| + |33 - 22| = 22.
It can be shown that changing all elements to any palindromic number other than 22 cannot be achieved at a lower cost.

The score of the final array is the frequency of the most frequent element in the array.
Return the maximum score you can achieve.
The frequency of an element is the number of occurences of that element in the array.
 
Example 1:

Explanation: We can do the following operations on the array:
- Choose i = 0, and increase the value of nums[0] by 1. The resulting array is [2,2,6,4].
- Choose i = 3, and decrease the value of nums[3] by 1. The resulting array is [2,2,6,3].
- Choose i = 3, and decrease the value of nums[3] by 1. The resulting array is [2,2,6,2].

2983,60,False,2983. Palindrome Rearrangement Queries,"You are given a 0-indexed string s having an even length n.
You are also given a 0-indexed 2D integer array, queries, where queries[i] = [ai, bi, ci, di].
For each query i, you are allowed to perform the following operations:

Rearrange the characters within the substring s[ai:bi], where 0 <= ai <= bi < n / 2.
Rearrange the characters within the substring s[ci:di], where n / 2 <= ci <= di < n.

For each query, your task is to determine whether it is possible to make s a palindrome by performing the operations.
Each query is answered independently of the others.
Return a 0-indexed array answer, where answer[i] == true if it is possible to make s a palindrome by performing operations specified by the ith query, and false otherwise.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
s[x:y] represents the substring consisting of characters from the index x to index y in s, both inclusive.

 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""abcabc"", queries = [[1,1,3,5],[0,2,5,5]]
Output: [true,true]
Explanation: In this example, there are two queries:
In the first query:
- a0 = 1, b0 = 1, c0 = 3, d0 = 5.
- So, you are allowed to rearrange s[1:1] => abcabc and s[3:5] => abcabc.
- To make s a palindrome, s[3:5] can be rearranged to become => abccba.
- Now, s is a palindrome. So, answer[0] = true.
In the second query:
- a1 = 0, b1 = 2, c1 = 5, d1 = 5.
- So, you are allowed to rearrange s[0:2] => abcabc and s[5:5] => abcabc.
- To make s a palindrome, s[0:2] can be rearranged to become => cbaabc.
- Now, s is a palindrome. So, answer[1] = true.

Example 2:
Input: s = ""abbcdecbba"", queries = [[0,2,7,9]]
Output: [false]
Explanation: In this example, there is only one query.
a0 = 0, b0 = 2, c0 = 7, d0 = 9.
So, you are allowed to rearrange s[0:2] => abbcdecbba and s[7:9] => abbcdecbba.
It is not possible to make s a palindrome by rearranging these substrings because s[3:6] is not a palindrome.
So, answer[0] = false.
Example 3:
Input: s = ""acbcab"", queries = [[1,2,4,5]]
Output: [true]
Explanation: In this example, there is only one query.
a0 = 1, b0 = 2, c0 = 4, d0 = 5.
So, you are allowed to rearrange s[1:2] => acbcab and s[4:5] => acbcab.
To make s a palindrome s[1:2] can be rearranged to become abccab.
Then, s[4:5] can be rearranged to become abccba.
Now, s is a palindrome. So, answer[0] = true.
 
Constraints:

2 <= n == s.length <= 105

2997,60,False,2997. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array XOR Equal to K,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and a positive integer k.
You can apply the following operation on the array any number of times:

Choose any element of the array and flip a bit in its binary representation. Flipping a bit means changing a 0 to 1 or vice versa.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make the bitwise XOR of all elements of the final array equal to k.
Note that you can flip leading zero bits in the binary representation of elements. For example, for the number (101)2 you can flip the fourth bit and obtain (1101)2.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,1,3,4], k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: We can do the following operations:
- Choose element 2 which is 3 == (011)2, we flip the first bit and we obtain (010)2 == 2. nums becomes [2,1,2,4].
- Choose element 0 which is 2 == (010)2, we flip the third bit and we obtain (110)2 = 6. nums becomes [6,1,2,4].
The XOR of elements of the final array is (6 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 4) == 1 == k.
It can be shown that we cannot make the XOR equal to k in less than 2 operations.

Example 2:

Explanation: 
For index = 0, length = 9 and width = 3. Diagonal length = sqrt(9 * 9 + 3 * 3) = sqrt(90) ≈ 9.487.
For index = 1, length = 8 and width = 6. Diagonal length = sqrt(8 * 8 + 6 * 6) = sqrt(100) = 10.
So, the rectangle at index 1 has a greater diagonal length therefore we return area = 8 * 6 = 48.
